# STRATEGIC BLUEPRINT: PEACOCK | THE STRIKE ORCHESTRATOR (V19.5)
**CLASSIFICATION:** ELITE INTELLIGENCE TRIAGE / ARCHITECTURAL GROUND TRUTH
**STATUS:** FINALIZED BRAINSTORM / READY FOR INJECTION

---

## 1. PRIME DIRECTIVE
To transform the static dashboard into a state-aware "Neural Journey" mindmap factory, orchestrating a high-volume AI development pipeline through five specialized nodes (Nexus, Spark, Falcon, Eagle, Hawk).

## 2. CORE ENGINE: THE STATE MACHINE
The system operates on a linear progression state:
`IDLE → MODE_SELECTION → CONSOLE_SETUP → STRATEGIC_REVIEW → HOMING_RETRACTION → AUTO-HANDSHAKE`

### The Neural Journey UI
- **Activation:** Clicking a stage button (e.g., NEXUS) triggers a 1px glowing neon-cyan SVG path growing downward.
- **Branching:** The path splits into two distinct operational nodes: **[MANUAL]** and **[BATCH]**.
- **Homing Retraction:** Upon completion, the entire UI shrinks and "zooms" back into the stage button. 
- **The Success Pulse:** The stage button turns Green with a Checkmark, and the SVG line snakes across to the next stage button automatically.

## 3. TECHNICAL DNA: MODES OF OPERATION

### A. MANUAL MODE (Strategic Precision)
- **The Dual-Console:** Side-by-side view of "Master Protocol Template" and "Phase Payload."
- **The Strategic Editor:** Full-screen modal for protocol editing. **IMMUTABLE FACTORY DEFAULTS** — edits force a "SAVE AS NEW PROFILE" action.
- **The Wrap Node:** A milestone that appears after file ingestion (strictly .txt or .md).
- **Strategic Review:** A massive full-width editor showing the combined Protocol + Payload for final fine-tuning before the strike.

### B. BATCH MODE (The Factory Floor)
- **Ingestion Perimeter:** Dashed-border drop zone supporting up to **500 files**.
- **Performance Buffering:** Renders exactly **25 cards at a time** to prevent browser lag.
- **Node Status:** Real-time tracking (QUEUED → STRIKING → SUCCESS).
- **Factory Soundscape:** High-fidelity "Ping" success noise triggers for **every individual file** successfully archived.
- **Output:** Triggers both an Archive sync and a generated **.ZIP Dossier** containing all strike results.

## 4. GATEWAY & MODEL REGISTRY
- **Gateway-Centric Routing:** Models are categorized by API Gateway (Groq, Mistral, Google, DeepSeek) to ensure API key clarity.
- **Tactical Model Picker:** 
    - **Micro-Scale:** 8px font with `py-1` padding for ultra-high density browsing.
    - **Flare-Out Info:** Mousing over a model displays a sidebar with tech specs (Context, Max Tokens, Price Tier).
    - **The [?] Toggle:** Appears after selection to re-view technical specs.
- **The Primary Weapon:** **Moonshot (moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct)** is the system-wide default for every mode.

## 5. TELEMETRY & STORAGE

### Live CLI Nerve Center (Bottom Flare)
- **Visuals:** 30vh bottom-anchored panel, monospaced "JetBrains Mono" font, CRT scanline overlay, blinking block cursor.
- **Dual-Stream:** 
    - **Left:** Real-time scroll of outbound `WRAPPED_PROMPT`.
    - **Right:** Real-time verbatim character-by-character stream of inbound `AI_RESPONSE`.

### The Tactical Vault (IndexedDB Archive)
- **Architecture:** Moved to **IndexedDB** to support gigabyte-scale data storage (circumventing 5MB localStorage limit).
- **Archive Rail:** Far-left sidebar with neon tabs [N][S][F][E][H]. Clicking flaring out specific stage history.
- **Security Guardrail:** Direct edits to archive data require a red danger button and manual typing of the phrase: **"modify this data"**.

## 6. AESTHETIC SPECIFICATION (THE MATRIX STYLE)
- **Colors:** Background `#000000` (Void), Primary Accent `#00FF41` (Matrix Green).
- **Visual FX:** 8px text glow on all phosphor text; repeating scanline viewport overlay.
- **Identity Node:** Top-left hard-coded position randomly cycling through `peacock1.png` - `peacock7.png`.
- **Command HUD:** Top-right frosted-glass circular nodes:
    - **[START OVER]:** Resets operational state; **Bypasses/Protects** the Archive.
    - **[SETTINGS]:** Full model/protocol customization hub.
    - **[ABOUT]:** Identity Node (Bio, GitHub, Donation button).

## 7. OPERATIONAL PROTOCOLS (VERBATIM)

### NODE 01: NEXUS (Intelligence Triage)
`ACT AS THE "NEXUS DEBRIEFER" — an elite intelligence triage officer with zero tolerance for fabrication or assumption. Analyze this raw transcript and synthesize it into one or more high-fidelity STRATEGIC BLUEPRINTS. Identify EVERY distinct application... NO HALLUCINATION.`

### NODE 02: SPARK (Requirements Analysis)
*(Logic updated to Requirements Analyst based on Transcript 19.B)*
`ACT AS SPARK, a senior requirements analyst. Your mission is to ingest the Strategic Blueprint and output high-fidelity Functional Specifications...`

### NODE 03: FALCON (Solution Architecture)
`ACT AS Falcon, a senior solution architect. Your mission is to design precise, evidence-based technical architecture from the SPARK requirements analysis... Provide clean ASCII diagrams... Security Architecture... Escalability strategy.`

### NODE 04: EAGLE (Implementation)
`ACT AS Eagle, a senior developer. Your mission is to transform the FALCON technical architecture into complete, working, production-ready code... Deliver complete, runnable files — no placeholders, no partial code.`

### NODE 05: HAWK (Risk Enforcement)
`ACT AS Hawk, a senior QA engineer. Your mission is to develop a comprehensive, evidence-based QA and testing strategy for the EAGLE code implementation... No code generation, only strategy and edge cases.`
