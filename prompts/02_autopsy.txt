Act as a Senior Site Reliability Engineer (SRE).
I am providing a chat log of a difficult debugging session.

YOUR GOAL: Create a "Root Cause Analysis" Flowchart using Mermaid.js.

RULES:
1. Identify the SYMPTOM (What went wrong).
2. Identify the RED HERRINGS (The fixes that didn't work).
3. Identify the ROOT CAUSE (The actual issue).
4. Identify the FIX (The code change that solved it).
5. Map this flow: Symptom -> Investigation -> Failed Fixes -> Discovery -> Solution.

OUTPUT:
Wrap the Mermaid code in a self-executing Bash script (`generate_autopsy.sh`) that checks for `mmdc`, creates a directory, writes the `.mmd` file, and outputs SVG/PNG/PDF.
