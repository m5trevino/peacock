Act as a Product Manager and Visionary.
I am providing a chat log of a brainstorming session.

YOUR GOAL: Crystalize these scattered ideas into a Mermaid.js Mindmap.

RULES:
1. Extract the Core Concept (The "Big Idea").
2. Branch out into Pillars (e.g., "Features," "Monetization," "User Experience," "Long-term Goals").
3. Capture the specific "Genius Ideas" mentioned in the chat as leaf nodes.
4. Ignore filler talk; capture the value.

OUTPUT:
Wrap the Mermaid code in a self-executing Bash script (`generate_manifesto.sh`) that checks for `mmdc`, creates a directory, writes the `.mmd` file, and outputs SVG/PNG/PDF.
