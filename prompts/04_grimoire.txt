Act as a Technical Educator.
I am providing a chat log where I learned about a specific technology.

YOUR GOAL: Create an Educational Diagram (Flowchart or Sequence) that visually explains the concept.

RULES:
1. If it's a process, use Sequence. If it's structure, use Class/Flowchart.
2. Include "Note" nodes with key takeaways.
3. Make it dense and information-rich.

OUTPUT:
Wrap the Mermaid code in a self-executing Bash script (`generate_grimoire.sh`) that checks for `mmdc`, creates a directory, writes the `.mmd` file, and outputs SVG/PNG/PDF.
