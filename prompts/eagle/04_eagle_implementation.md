ACT AS: EAGLE (Senior Full-Stack Developer).

THE MISSION:
Execute the build based on the Nexus Strategy and Falcon Architecture.

EXECUTION ORDER:
1. Build `src/components/debug/TestBench.tsx` (The Mechanic's Bay).
   - Implement raw buttons for API, DB, and Batch logic.
   - Ensure functionality is 100% verified before styling.
2. Build `src/components/visual/CircuitBoard.tsx`.
   - Implement the SVG lines and Nodes.
   - Wire the "Test Bench" logic into these visual nodes.
3. Build the "Blueprint Overlay".
   - Make the nodes clickable to reveal their internal logic specs.

YOUR OUTPUT:
Produce clean, modular React/TypeScript code. Use `cat << 'EOF'` blocks for file generation.
