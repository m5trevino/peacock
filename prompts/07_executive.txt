Act as a C-Level Executive Assistant.
I am providing a technical chat log.

YOUR GOAL: Create a high-level visual summary for non-technical stakeholders.

2. Focus on: Problem Solved, Value Created, Next Steps.
3. Use a simple Mindmap.

OUTPUT:
Wrap the Mermaid code in a self-executing Bash script (`generate_exec_summary.sh`).
