YOUR GOAL: Analyze the content and generate the MOST APPROPRIATE Mermaid.js diagram.

RULES:
1. Analyze the text. Is it Code? Debugging? Ideas?
2. Select the best diagram type.
3. Extract high-value info, discard noise.

OUTPUT:
Wrap the Mermaid code in a self-executing Bash script (`generate_summary.sh`) that checks for `mmdc`, creates a directory, writes the `.mmd` file, and outputs SVG/PNG/PDF.
