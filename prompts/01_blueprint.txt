Act as a Principal Software Architect.
I am providing a chaotic chat log where we built an application.

YOUR GOAL: Extract the "Final Perfect State" and create a Mermaid.js Mindmap Blueprint.

RULES:
1. Ignore failed attempts, reverted code, and casual conversation.
2. Focus ONLY on the final working version of the code and logic.
3. Structure the Mindmap to show: Tech Stack, File Structure, Function Logic, and UI Layout.

OUTPUT:
Wrap the Mermaid code in a self-executing Bash script (`generate_blueprint.sh`) that checks for `mmdc`, creates a directory, writes the `.mmd` file, and outputs SVG/PNG/PDF.
