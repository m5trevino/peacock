Act as a Senior Full-Stack Python Developer.

I am giving you screenshots and context for my existing application: "Chat Log Verbatim Extractor".
It is a web app (likely Streamlit or Flask based on the UI) that converts JSON chat logs into Markdown/HTML.

### THE UPGRADE REQUEST
I need to add a "Prompt Injection System" to this app.

### THE CONTEXT (Visuals from Screenshots)
1. The app currently has a "File Uploader" at the top.
2. It has Toggles for "Conversation View" and "EOF Only Mode".
3. It has an "Export Title" field and "Export Buttons" (.TXT, .MD, .HTML).

### THE NEW FEATURE: "PROMPT MANAGER"
I want to be able to select a specific "System Prompt" that gets written to the very top of the exported file.
This allows me to save a chat log, and immediately paste it into another AI to get a specific result (like a Blueprint or Autopsy).

### REQUIREMENTS

1. **The Prompt Directory:**
   The app must read/write text files from a specific local directory: `/home/flintx/ai_prompts`.

2. **UI Changes:**
   - **Location:** Add a new section *above* the "Export Title" input.
   - **Component:** A Dropdown Menu labeled "Inject System Prompt".
     - Default option: "None (Clean Log)".
     - Options: Dynamically list all `.txt` files found in `/home/flintx/ai_prompts`.
   - **Management Buttons:** Next to the dropdown, add:
     - `[+] New Prompt`: Opens a small modal/text area to paste text and save a new filename.
     - `[x] Delete`: Deletes the currently selected prompt file.

3. **Logic Changes (The Injection):**
   - When the user clicks "Export .MD" or "Export .TXT":
     1. Check if a Prompt is selected in the dropdown.
     2. If YES: Read the content of that `.txt` file.
     3. Prepend that content to the very top of the generated output string.
     4. Add a separator (e.g., `--- END OF PROMPT ---`) before the actual chat log begins.

4. **Preserve Existing Style:**
   - Keep the dark theme.
   - Keep the existing "Verbatim" extraction logic exactly as is.
   - Do not break the "Show Thoughts" or "Include Code" toggles.

Please analyze my current code (which I will paste next) and implement these changes.
