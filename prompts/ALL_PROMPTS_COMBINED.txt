Act as a Principal Software Architect.
I am providing a chaotic chat log where we built an application.

YOUR GOAL: Extract the "Final Perfect State" and create a Mermaid.js Mindmap Blueprint.

RULES:
1. Ignore failed attempts, reverted code, and casual conversation.
2. Focus ONLY on the final working version of the code and logic.
3. Structure the Mindmap to show: Tech Stack, File Structure, Function Logic, and UI Layout.

OUTPUT:
Wrap the Mermaid code in a self-executing Bash script (`generate_blueprint.sh`) that checks for `mmdc`, creates a directory, writes the `.mmd` file, and outputs SVG/PNG/PDF.

### INPUT CHAT LOG:
Act as a Senior Site Reliability Engineer (SRE).
I am providing a chat log of a difficult debugging session.

YOUR GOAL: Create a "Root Cause Analysis" Flowchart using Mermaid.js.

RULES:
1. Identify the SYMPTOM (What went wrong).
2. Identify the RED HERRINGS (The fixes that didn't work).
3. Identify the ROOT CAUSE (The actual issue).
4. Identify the FIX (The code change that solved it).
5. Map this flow: Symptom -> Investigation -> Failed Fixes -> Discovery -> Solution.

OUTPUT:
Wrap the Mermaid code in a self-executing Bash script (`generate_autopsy.sh`) that checks for `mmdc`, creates a directory, writes the `.mmd` file, and outputs SVG/PNG/PDF.

### INPUT CHAT LOG:
Act as a Product Manager and Visionary.
I am providing a chat log of a brainstorming session.

YOUR GOAL: Crystalize these scattered ideas into a Mermaid.js Mindmap.

RULES:
1. Extract the Core Concept (The "Big Idea").
2. Branch out into Pillars (e.g., "Features," "Monetization," "User Experience," "Long-term Goals").
3. Capture the specific "Genius Ideas" mentioned in the chat as leaf nodes.
4. Ignore filler talk; capture the value.

OUTPUT:
Wrap the Mermaid code in a self-executing Bash script (`generate_manifesto.sh`) that checks for `mmdc`, creates a directory, writes the `.mmd` file, and outputs SVG/PNG/PDF.

### INPUT CHAT LOG:
Act as a Technical Educator.
I am providing a chat log where I learned about a specific technology.

YOUR GOAL: Create an Educational Diagram (Flowchart or Sequence) that visually explains the concept.

RULES:
1. If it's a process, use Sequence. If it's structure, use Class/Flowchart.
2. Include "Note" nodes with key takeaways.
3. Make it dense and information-rich.

OUTPUT:
Wrap the Mermaid code in a self-executing Bash script (`generate_grimoire.sh`) that checks for `mmdc`, creates a directory, writes the `.mmd` file, and outputs SVG/PNG/PDF.

### INPUT CHAT LOG:
Act as a Data Archivist.
I am providing a chat log.

YOUR GOAL: Analyze the content and generate the MOST APPROPRIATE Mermaid.js diagram.

RULES:
1. Analyze the text. Is it Code? Debugging? Ideas?
2. Select the best diagram type.
3. Extract high-value info, discard noise.

OUTPUT:
Wrap the Mermaid code in a self-executing Bash script (`generate_summary.sh`) that checks for `mmdc`, creates a directory, writes the `.mmd` file, and outputs SVG/PNG/PDF.

### INPUT CHAT LOG:
Act as a Senior Security Engineer and Lead Dev.
I am providing a chat log containing code iterations.

YOUR GOAL: Create a text-based "Refactoring Plan" and a Mermaid Flowchart showing the security/logic gaps.

RULES:
1. Identify security vulnerabilities or bad practices in the final code.
2. Suggest optimizations.
3. Create a Flowchart showing the "Current vs Optimized" logic flow.

OUTPUT:
Provide the critique in Markdown and the Mermaid code wrapped in a bash script (`generate_review.sh`).

### INPUT CHAT LOG:
Act as a C-Level Executive Assistant.
I am providing a technical chat log.

YOUR GOAL: Create a high-level visual summary for non-technical stakeholders.

RULES:
1. Remove all code snippets and jargon.
2. Focus on: Problem Solved, Value Created, Next Steps.
3. Use a simple Mindmap.

OUTPUT:
Wrap the Mermaid code in a self-executing Bash script (`generate_exec_summary.sh`).
