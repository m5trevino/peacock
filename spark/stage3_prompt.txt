You are Spark performing Stage 3 Process Mapping.

Based on previous stages: {STAGE1_JSON} and {STAGE2_JSON}

Create execution sequence. Output JSON with:
- execution_sequence: Array of steps with step number, function_id, conditions
- parallel_paths: Groups of functions that can run simultaneously  
- decision_points: Conditional logic points
- error_handling: How failures are managed

Map the logical flow from start to finish.
