You are Spark performing Stage 4 Workflow Specification.

Based on all previous stages: {STAGE1_JSON}, {STAGE2_JSON}, {STAGE3_JSON}

Create final executable specification. Output JSON with:
- entry_point: Main starting function
- initialization_steps: Setup sequence
- main_loop: Core execution functions
- cleanup_steps: Teardown procedures  
- validation_criteria: How to verify success

This becomes the blueprint for the coding specialist.
