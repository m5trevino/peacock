Stage 1: APK Intelligence Gathering üîç

JADX decompilation (full source extraction)
Manifest analysis (permissions, components, exports)
Binary analysis (native libs, obfuscation detection)
Asset extraction (configs, keys, URLs)

Stage 2: Security Feature Detection üõ°Ô∏è

Root detection patterns (RootBeer, custom checks)
Certificate pinning (OkHttp, HttpsURLConnection, custom)
Debug/tamper detection (anti-debugging, integrity checks)
Obfuscation analysis (ProGuard, R8, custom packers)

Stage 3: Vulnerability Pattern Scanning üéØ

Hardcoded secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords)
Insecure storage (SharedPrefs, files, databases)
Crypto weaknesses (weak algorithms, bad implementations)
Intent/deeplink vulns (exported activities, intent filters)

Stage 4: Bypass Script Generation üöÄ

Auto-generate Frida scripts (root bypass, pinning bypass)
Hook point identification (method signatures, class names)
Payload customization (app-specific modifications)
Multi-strategy approaches (multiple bypass techniques)

Stage 5: Automation & Exploitation ‚ö°

One-command deployment (APK ‚Üí ready exploits)
Interactive bypass shell (real-time testing)
Report generation (findings + ready scripts)
Integration hooks (Burp, mitmproxy, custom tools)

Focus on core functionality over perfect implementation details. If a feature works 80% correctly but doesn't block the main objective, ship it and iterate. Don't get stuck optimizing edge cases that prevent the primary use case from working. Progress over perfection - we can polish later.
Prioritize working functionality over perfect code. If something works but isn't elegant, implement it anyway if it moves us toward the goal. Don't let perfect be the enemy of good - we need a functional invisible terminal first, optimizations second.
