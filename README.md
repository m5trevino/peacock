# 🦚 PEACOCK V25.5: THE ORBITAL STRIKE HUD
**Anti-Vibe Coding App // Tactical Operations Center**

## 💀 THE MISSION
Peacock is a high-performance, local-first AI orchestration dashboard designed for surgical code generation and strategic project building. It decouples the complex "Thinking" layer from the "Execution" layer, guiding you through a 5-phase kill chain: **Spark ➔ Falcon ➔ Eagle ➔ Owl ➔ Hawk.**

## 🏗️ SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
Peacock is split into two specialized components:
1.  **The HUD (Frontend):** A high-octane React (Vite) interface that implements the **Visual Doctrine** (Gunmetal Slate, 350px Animated Pods, and Verbatim CLI).
2.  **The Engine (AI-Handler):** A standalone Node.js service that manages API key rotation, proxy tunneling, and local filesystem persistence.

## ⚡ VISUAL DOCTRINE
*   **Palette:** Gunmetal Slate (`#0D0F12`) / Matrix Green (`#00FF41`) / Voltage Yellow (`#FFD700`).
*   **Physics:** No fading. Pure **Descramble** and **Mechanical Slide** animations.
*   **Chamber Focus:** A single, massive animated pod projects the active phase, minimizing clutter.
*   **Map of Destiny:** A horizontal thumbtack schematic at the top center, showing real-time energy surges across the project pipeline.

## 🚀 OPERATIONAL WORKFLOW
1.  **Ignite Engine:** Run `npm run dev` in the `/ai-handler` directory (Port 8888).
2.  **Launch HUD:** Run `npm run dev` in the root directory (Port 3000).
3.  **Slot Data:** Select a **Start** file in the Spark phase to initialize the project DNA.
4.  **Arm Strategy:** Pick a **Mission Profile** (Prompt) from the Arsenal.
5.  **Strike:** Execute the drive and watch the intelligence surge through the Mini-Map.

## 📂 DIRECTORY MATRIX
*   `/prompts/[phase]/`: Tactical mission profiles.
*   `/start/`: Raw project payloads.
*   `/sessions/`: Flat-file JSON database for full project re-hydration.
*   `/public/assets/images/`: 350px Alpha-Transparent `.webm` pods.
