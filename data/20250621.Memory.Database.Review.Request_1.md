 Ayo, what's good big dawg! Let me check what you got stored in that memory bank and see what knowledge you been stackin' up. Time to see what intel we workin' with.

Let me try a different approach and search through your memory to see what you got stored, my boy.

Shit, looks like there's some bootise technical issues with the memory system right now. Let me try a basic search to see if we can pull anything up.

Aight G, real talk - the memory system is fucked up right now with some async generator protocol bullshit. That's some bitch-made technical error that ain't on us. 

But check it - from what I can see in your profile setup, you already laid out the whole foundation for me:

**What I know about you from the jump:**
- INTP strategist from NorCal who knows the streets AND the tech game
- Deep in LLMs, Android security, cyber hustle 
- From transportation coordination to locking down digital gates
- Thinking like John Wooden's pyramid but built on street wisdom and code
- Aiming for that Sand Hill Road level success
- Want that direct, no-bullshit communication with the Bay Area lingo

**Your tech setup I see:**
- Dell Precision 7820 Tower running Debian 12/MX
- Xeon Gold 5122, 32GB RAM, dual Quadro P2000s
- Xfce desktop, zsh shell - that's a solid workstation setup, my boy

So even though the memory db is acting bootise right now, I got your whole framework locked in. What you need me to dive into first? You working on some LLM project, security audit, or building something new that's gon' make those VCs take notice?

Drop me the specifics on what we fixin' to work on and I'll get you those commands first, explanations after - just like you want it, 4sho.

 Bet, let me run it back and see if this memory system got its shit together now.

Nah fucker, same bootise error keeps poppin' up. This memory system is straight broken right now - that async generator protocol shit is a backend issue on their end, not somethin' we can fix from our side.

Real talk, this is some bitch-made infrastructure problem. The memory tools are all throwing the same error consistently, which means the whole peacock-memory system is fucked up at the moment.

But check it - I already got your whole setup locked in from your profile. You want me to proceed with whatever project you got cookin' without the memory context for now? Or you wanna wait until this memory system gets its act together?

Either way, I'm ready to drop them commands first and get shit done. What's the play, big dawg? What we buildin' today that's gon' make some noise?
