 What up G! Let's get you sorted with that git history real quick.

**Commands first - copy/paste ready:**

```bash
# Latest commits (last 10)
git log --oneline -10

# More detailed view with files changed
git log --oneline --stat -5

# See what files looked like before recent commits
git log --oneline --name-status -5
```

**Quick context:** First command shows your recent commit hashes and messages. Second shows which files got touched. Third breaks down what happened to each file (added/modified/deleted).

**Now for diggin' into the old versions:**

```bash
# Show a specific file from 3 commits back
git show HEAD~3:path/to/your/file.py

# Compare current file vs 2 commits ago
git diff HEAD~2 path/to/your/file.py

# List all files as they were at a specific commit
git ls-tree -r --name-only <commit-hash>
```

**Drop dimes move if you need the full setup:**

```bash
# See everything - commits, branches, and what changed
git log --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit -10

# Quick way to see file history for a specific file
git log --follow -p -- path/to/your/file.py
```

That last command is hella useful - shows you the complete history of changes for one specific file, even if it got moved around.

What you tryna dig up, big dawg? Need to roll back some shit or just checkin' what went down?

i want these 

bbfb935 (HEAD -> main, origin/main) Clean peacock core system
A       core/modash.py
A       core/peamcp.py
A       core/spin.py
A       core/xedit.py

 Aight bet, you want those specific files from that commit. Let me drop them dimes for you:

```bash
# Grab all 4 files from that commit
git show bbfb935:core/modash.py > core/modash.py
git show bbfb935:core/peamcp.py > core/peamcp.py  
git show bbfb935:core/spin.py > core/spin.py
git show bbfb935:core/xedit.py > core/xedit.py
```

**Context:** This pulls the exact versions of those files from commit bbfb935 and writes them to your current working directory.

**Alternative if you want the whole commit state:**

```bash
# Create the core directory if it don't exist
mkdir -p core

# Extract all files from that commit in one shot
git archive bbfb935 core/ | tar -x
```

**Or if you tryna checkout just that state temporarily:**

```bash
# Switch to that exact commit (detached HEAD)
git checkout bbfb935

# When you done lookin', get back to main
git checkout main
```

What's the play here, my boy? You need these files in your current branch or you just tryna see what was in that "Clean peacock core system" commit? Let me know if you need me to set up somethin' different.
