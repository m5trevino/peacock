look at those files in the projext knowelsdge... 

i want to add this helper app called anti-vibe codebase to the peacock-memory... 
if you look at it and read it all you'll understand why

 What up G! Let me check out that project knowledge to see what we got cookin' with peacock-memory and this anti-vibe codebase joint.

Aight G, I see what we got! Let me dig deeper to understand the full picture here:

Now I can see the whole picture! 4sho, my boy! The anti-vibe codebase is a helper app that integrates with peacock-memory, and I understand exactly why you want to add it. Let me dig deeper into that anti-vibe codebase:

YO, I GET IT NOW! 🔥 

The anti-vibe codebase is the PERFECT companion to peacock-memory! Let me break down exactly why this integration makes so much sense:

**ANTI-VIBE CODEBASE = GUI Frontend for Peacock-Memory Backend**

The anti-vibe codebase gives you:
- 🎨 **Cyberpunk GUI** - Visual file management with that sick retro aesthetic
- 📁 **File Operations** - Add, remove, scan directories, organize projects  
- ✏️ **Code Editing** - Dual-pane editor with original vs modified views
- 🔄 **Marker Systems** - Split large files into 4 or 8 sections for navigation
- 🚀 **Direct Sync** - Pipes directly to `pea-mem codebase` commands
- 📦 **Export Options** - ZIP archives, merged files, clean versions

While peacock-memory gives you:
- 💾 **Backend Storage** - Smart path management, project organization
- 🔗 **Claude Integration** - MCP server, conversation imports
- 📊 **CLI Tools** - `pea-mem` commands for automation
- 🧠 **Knowledge Management** - Memory storage, search, sync capabilities

**PERFECT COMBO = Visual Frontend + Powerful Backend!**

Now let me drop some dimes to integrate this properly. First, let me check what directory structure we're working with:
```

```

#4 - List Commands (list-code)


This is HELLA STRAIGHTFORWARD! Just query the database and group by project.


This is ALL achievable and NOT super hard at all! Here's why:


✅ Smart Filename: Just path manipulation logic

✅ Directory Auto-detection: Already partially implemented in your codebase

✅ Interactive Dir Import: Standard CLI input handling with file listing

✅ List Commands: Database queries with grouping


LET ME DROP SOME DIMES TO IMPLEMENT THIS! 🔥


First, let me check the current add-code implementation to see what we're working with:

```
This block is not supported on your current device yet.
```

ALRIGHT G! I found the current `add-code` implementation! Now I can see exactly what we're working with. Let me get the CodeFileManager to understand the current storage system:
```
This block is not supported on your current device yet.
```

PERFECT! Now I can see the full picture, G! 🔥 You've got a solid foundation already. Let me create the implementation to give you EXACTLY what you want. This is gonna be some next-level shit!
