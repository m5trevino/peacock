`"What files are in my peacock knowledge base?"`

------------------------------------------------------------
[CLAUDE RESPONSE #001] - 2025-06-12 03:02:04
------------------------------------------------------------

 What up, big dawg! I see you tryna check your peacock knowledge base, but real talk - I can't see no files in your system from this chat, my boy. That shit ain't accessible to me right now.

Here's what's real: I need you to either upload them files to this chat or tell me the specific path where they at on your Debian setup. Once you drop them in here or give me the location, I can break down what's in there for you, 4sho.

If they sittin' somewhere on your Precision 7820, you could run somethin' like:

```bash
find /path/to/peacock/knowledge/base -type f -name "*" | head -20
```

That'll show you the first 20 files in that directory. Or if you want the full breakdown:

```bash
ls -la /path/to/peacock/knowledge/base/
```

But yo, what's the play here? You buildin' somethin' with that peacock data or just need to map out what you got? Let me know the path or drop them files and I'll break down the whole structure for you, G.

What's good though - you got a specific project you workin' on with that knowledge base?

============================================================
[USER ENTRY #002] - 2025-06-12 03:02:22

i cant get fucking basic-mempory working

------------------------------------------------------------
[CLAUDE RESPONSE #002] - 2025-06-12 03:02:30
------------------------------------------------------------

 Aight, hold up G - I need more intel on this basic-memory shit you dealin' with. You talkin' about:

- Some memory management library you tryna implement?
- A basic memory allocator you buildin'?
- Memory issues with your peacock knowledge base?
- Some specific code module called "basic-memory"?
- Memory problems with your Debian setup?

Real talk, I can't drop the right dimes without knowin' what the fuck we dealin' with here. Is this a Python module, C library, some custom shit you built, or what?

Hit me with:
1. What language/platform this basic-memory thing is
2. What error messages you seein' 
3. What you tryna accomplish with it
4. Any code or config files involved

Don't leave me guessin', my boy. I need the specifics so I can break this shit down proper and get you back on track. You know how it is - can't fix what I can't see.

What's the real situation here? Drop the details and I'll map out the solution for you, 4sho.

AI Assistant Guide - Basic Memory
8–10 minutes
This guide helps you, the AI assistant, use Basic Memory tools effectively when working with users. It covers reading, writing, and navigating knowledge through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
Quick Reference
Overview
Basic Memory allows you and users to record context in local Markdown files, building a rich knowledge base through natural conversations. The system automatically creates a semantic knowledge graph from simple text patterns.
    Local-First: All data is stored in plain text files on the user’s computer
    Real-Time: Users see content updates immediately
    Bi-Directional: Both you and users can read and edit notes
    Semantic: Simple patterns create a structured knowledge graph
    Persistent: Knowledge persists across sessions and conversations
The Importance of the Knowledge Graph
Basic Memory’s value comes from connections between notes, not just the notes themselves. When writing notes, your primary goal should be creating a rich, interconnected knowledge graph.
When creating content, focus on:
    Increasing Semantic Density: Add multiple observations and relations to each note
    Using Accurate References: Aim to reference existing entities by their exact titles
    Creating Forward References: Feel free to reference entities that don’t exist yet - Basic Memory will resolve these when they’re created later
    Creating Bidirectional Links: When appropriate, connect entities from both directions
    Using Meaningful Categories: Add semantic context with appropriate observation categories
    Choosing Precise Relations: Use specific relation types that convey meaning
Core Tools Reference
Essential Content Management
Writing knowledge (most important tool):
write_note(
    title="Search Design",
    content="# Search Design\n...",
    folder="specs",                     # Optional
    tags=["search", "design"],          # v0.13.0: now searchable!
    project="work-notes"                # v0.13.0: target specific project
)
Reading knowledge:
read_note("Search Design")              # By title
read_note("specs/search-design")        # By path
read_note("memory://specs/search")      # By memory URL
Viewing notes as formatted artifacts (Claude Desktop):
view_note("Search Design")              # Creates readable artifact
view_note("specs/search-design")        # By permalink
view_note("memory://specs/search")      # By memory URL
Incremental editing (v0.13.0):
edit_note(
    identifier="Search Design",         # Must be EXACT title/permalink (strict matching)
    operation="append",                 # append, prepend, find_replace, replace_section
    content="\n## New Section\nContent here..."
)
File organization (v0.13.0):
move_note(
    identifier="Old Note",              # Must be EXACT title/permalink (strict matching)
    destination="archive/old-note.md"   # Folders created automatically
)
Project Management (v0.13.0)
list_projects()                         # Show available projects
switch_project("work-notes")            # Change active project
get_current_project()                   # Current project info
Search & Discovery
search_notes("authentication system")   # v0.13.0: includes frontmatter tags
build_context("memory://specs/search")  # Follow knowledge graph connections
recent_activity(timeframe="1 week")     # Check what's been updated
memory:// URLs Explained
Basic Memory uses a special URL format to reference entities in the knowledge graph:
Semantic Markdown Format
Knowledge is encoded in standard markdown using simple patterns:
Facts about an entity:
- [category] This is an observation #tag1 #tag2 (optional context)
Common Categories & Relation Types:
    Categories: [idea], [decision], [question], [fact], [requirement], [technique], [recipe], [preference]
    Relations: relates_to, implements, requires, extends, part_of, pairs_with, inspired_by, originated_from
When to Record Context
Protocol for recording context:
    Identify valuable information in the conversation
    Ask the user: “Would you like me to record our discussion about [topic] in Basic Memory?”
    If they agree, use write_note to capture the information
    If they decline, continue without recording
    Let the user know when information has been recorded: “I’ve saved our discussion about [topic] to Basic Memory.”
Understanding User Interactions
Users will interact with Basic Memory in patterns like:

v0.13.0 Workflow Examples
Multi-Project Conversations
User: “I need to update my work documentation and also add a personal recipe note.”
Workflow:
    list_projects() - Check available projects
    write_note(title="Sprint Planning", project="work-notes") - Work content
    write_note(title="Weekend Recipes", project="personal") - Personal content
Incremental Note Building
User: “Add a troubleshooting section to my setup guide.”
Workflow:
    edit_note(identifier="Setup Guide", operation="append", content="\n## Troubleshooting\n...")
User: “Update the authentication section in my API docs.”
Workflow:
    edit_note(identifier="API Documentation", operation="replace_section", section="## Authentication")
Smart File Organization
User: “My notes are getting messy in the main folder.”
Workflow:
    move_note("Old Meeting Notes", "archive/2024/old-meetings.md")
    move_note("Project Notes", "projects/client-work/notes.md")
Creating Effective Relations
When creating relations:
    Reference existing entities by their exact title: [[Exact Title]]
    Create forward references to entities that don’t exist yet - they’ll be linked automatically when created
    Search first to find existing entities to reference
    Use meaningful relation types: implements, requires, part_of vs generic relates_to
Example workflow:
    search_notes("travel") to find existing travel-related notes
    Reference found entities: - part_of [[Japan Travel Guide]]
    Add forward references: - located_in [[Tokyo]] (even if Tokyo note doesn’t exist yet)

Using stdin with Basic Memory’s write_note Tool
The write-note tool supports reading content from standard input (stdin), allowing for more flexible workflows when creating or updating notes in your Basic Memory knowledge base.
Use Cases
This feature is particularly useful for:
    Piping output from other commands directly into Basic Memory notes
    Creating notes with multi-line content without having to escape quotes or special characters
    Integrating with AI assistants like Claude Code that can generate content and pipe it to Basic Memory
    Processing text data from files or other sources
Basic Usage
Method 1: Using a Pipe
You can pipe content from another command into write_note:
# Pipe output of a command into a new note
echo "# My Note\n\nThis is a test note" | basic-memory tool write-note --title "Test Note" --folder "notes"
# Pipe output of a file into a new note
cat README.md | basic-memory tool write-note --title "Project README" --folder "documentation"
# Process text through other tools before saving as a note
cat data.txt | grep "important" | basic-memory tool write-note --title "Important Data" --folder "data"
Method 2: Using Heredoc Syntax
For multi-line content, you can use heredoc syntax:
# Create a note with heredoc
cat << EOF | basic-memory tool write_note --title "Project Ideas" --folder "projects"
# Project Ideas for Q2
## AI Integration
- Improve recommendation engine
- Add semantic search to product catalog
## Infrastructure
- Migrate to Kubernetes
- Implement CI/CD pipeline

Knowledge Format - Basic Memory
4–5 minutes
Understanding how Basic Memory structures knowledge will help you create richer, more connected notes. Here’s how the semantic patterns work.
File-First Architecture
All knowledge in Basic Memory is stored in plain text Markdown files:
Core Document Structure
Every document uses this basic structure:
---
title: Document Title
type: note
tags: [tag1, tag2]
permalink: custom-path
---
# Document Title
Regular markdown content...
## Observations
- [category] Content with #tags (optional context)
## Relations
- relation_type [[Other Document]] (optional context)
Frontmatter
The YAML frontmatter at the top of each file defines essential metadata:
---
title: Document Title    # Used for linking and references
type: note               # Document type
tags: [tag1, tag2]       # For organization and searching
permalink: custom-link   # Optional custom URL path
---
Observations
Observations are facts or statements about a topic:
- [tech] Uses SQLite for storage #database
- [design] Follows local-first architecture #architecture
- [decision] Selected bcrypt for passwords #security (Based on audit)
Each observation contains:
    Category in [brackets] - classifies the information type
    Content text - the main information
    Optional #tags - additional categorization
    Optional (context) - supporting details
Relations
Relations connect documents to form the knowledge graph:
- implements [[Search Design]]
- depends_on [[Database Schema]]
- relates_to [[User Interface]]
You can also create inline references:
This builds on [[Core Design]] and uses [[Utility Functions]].
Common relation types include:
    implements: Implementation of a specification
    depends_on: Required dependency
    relates_to: General connection
    inspired_by: Source of ideas
    extends: Enhancement
    part_of: Component relationship
    contains: Hierarchical relationship
    pairs_with: Complementary relationship
Knowledge Graph
Basic Memory automatically builds a knowledge graph from your document connections:
    Each document becomes a node in the graph
    Relations create edges between nodes
    Relation types add semantic meaning to connections
    Forward references can link to documents that don’t exist yet
This graph enables rich context building and navigation across your knowledge base.
Permalinks and memory:// URLs
Every document in Basic Memory has a unique permalink that serves as its stable identifier:
How Permalinks Work
You can specify a custom permalink in the frontmatter:
---
title: Authentication Approaches
permalink: auth-approaches-2024
---
If not specified, one will be generated automatically from the title, if the note has has a frontmatter section.
By default a notes’ permalink value will not change if the file is moved. It’s a stable identifier. But if you’d rather permalinks are always updated when a file moves, you can set the config setting in the global config.
The config file for Basic Memory is in the home directory under .basic-memory/config.json.
To change the behavior, set the following value:
~/.basic-memory/config.json 
{
  "update_permalinks_on_move": true
}
Using memory:// URLs
The memory:// URL scheme provides a reliable way to reference knowledge:
memory://auth-approaches-2024        # Direct access by permalink
memory://Authentication Approaches   # Access by title (automatically resolves)
memory://project/auth-approaches     # Access by path
Memory URLs support pattern matching for more powerful queries:
memory://auth*                      # All documents with permalinks starting with "auth"
memory://*/approaches               # All documents with permalinks ending with "approaches"
memory://project/*/requirements     # All requirements documents in the project folder
memory://docs/search/implements/*   # Follow all implements relations from search docs
This addressing scheme ensures content remains accessible even as your knowledge base evolves and files are reorganized.
File Organization
Organize files in any structure that suits your needs:
docs/
  architecture/
    design.md
    patterns.md
  features/
    search.md
    auth.md
You can:
    Group by topic in folders
    Use a flat structure with descriptive filenames
    Tag files for easier discovery
    Add custom metadata in frontmatter

Getting Started - Basic Memory
7–9 minutes
Basic Memory works through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to connect with AI assistants like Claude. Here’s how to set it up.
Basic Memory uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to connect with LLMs. It can be used with any service that supports the MCP, but Claude Desktop works especially well.
Installation
Prerequisites
The easiest way to install basic memory is via uv. See the uv installation guide.
Configure Claude Desktop
Edit your Claude Desktop config, located at:
    macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
    Windows: %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "basic-memory": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "basic-memory",
        "mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
Restart Claude Desktop. You should see Basic Memory tools available in the “tools” menu in Claude Desktop (the little hammer icon in the bottom-right corner of the chat interface). Click it to view available tools.
tools-menu
Install Basic Memory (Optional)
# Stable release (recommended)
uv tool install basic-memory
# or: pip install basic-memory

# Update to latest beta
pip install --upgrade basic-memory --pre
# Get latest development build
pip install --upgrade basic-memory --pre --force-reinstall
Troubleshooting Installation
Fix Path to uv
If you get an error that says ENOENT , this most likely means Claude Desktop could not find your uv installation. Make sure that you have uv installed per the instructions above, then:
Step 1: Find the absolute path to uvx
Open Terminal and run:
which uvx
This will show you the full path (e.g., /Users/yourusername/.cargo/bin/uvx).
Step 2: Edit Claude Desktop Configuration
Edit the Claude Desktop config:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "basic-memory": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/uvx",
      "args": [
        "basic-memory",
        "mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
Replace /absolute/path/to/uvx with the actual path you found in Step 1.
Step 3: Restart Claude Desktop
Close and reopen Claude Desktop for the changes to take effect.
Claude Says “No Basic Memory Tools Available”
If Claude cannot find Basic Memory tools:
    Check absolute paths: Ensure you’re using complete absolute paths to uvx in the Claude Desktop configuration
    Verify installation: Run basic-memory --version in Terminal to confirm Basic Memory is installed
    Restart applications: Restart both Terminal and Claude Desktop after making configuration changes
    Check sync status: You can view the sync status by running basic-memory status
Permission Issues
If you encounter permission errors:
    Check that Basic Memory has access to create files in your home directory
    Ensure Claude Desktop has permission to execute the uvx command

Basic Memory - Basic Memory
4-5 minutes
Basic Memory transforms how you work with AI - instead of losing valuable insights in conversation history, you build a persistent knowledge base where both you and AI can read, write, and enhance each other’s work.
hero
True AI Collaboration
Unlike typical AI tools where you ask questions and get answers, Basic Memory creates genuine collaboration:
    You capture ideas quickly → AI structures and enhances them
    AI creates comprehensive research → You add personal insights and connections
    Both build on each other’s work → Knowledge grows smarter over time
    Your notes are local → Edit and update notes and changes are synced
Every note becomes part of a semantic knowledge graph that reveals connections you never would have seen otherwise.
Pick up conversations exactly where you left off
No more “Can you remind me what we discussed?” or “Here’s what I learned before…” - AI assistants access your entire knowledge history instantly.
You: "Continue our discussion about the database architecture"
AI: [Loads relevant context from your knowledge base]
"Based on our previous conversations and your notes about performance requirements, 
I see we were exploring PostgreSQL vs. MongoDB. Looking at your updated benchmarking 
results from last week..."
Knowledge that compounds
Basic Memory doesn’t just save chat snippets - AI creates comprehensive, detailed notes that connect to everything you’ve learned before:
Beyond Chat Summaries
    2,000+ word research documents instead of brief summaries
    Technical deep-dives that build on previous architecture decisions
    Creative project notes that track character development and plot evolution
    Personal reflections that reveal life patterns and growth over time
Semantic Connections
Every piece of knowledge is semantically tagged and related:
## Neural Networks Research
- [breakthrough] Transformer architecture revolutionized NLP #architecture
- [application] Enables large language models like GPT and Claude #llm
- [limitation] Computational requirements limit accessibility #resource-constraint
## Relations
- builds_on [[Artificial Intelligence History]]
- enables [[Modern AI Applications]]  
- influences [[AI Ethics Considerations]]
The knowledge graph automatically suggests connections across domains - your AI research might connect to philosophy notes, which link to creative writing projects.

[CLAUDE RESPONSE #003] - 2025-06-12 03:05:39
------------------------------------------------------------

 Yo, what up big dawg! I see you tryna get Basic Memory locked and loaded, but that shit ain't cooperatin'. Let me break this down for you real quick.

Looking at the setup, you already got the MCP config right in Claude Desktop with the uvx command, but somethin' ain't clicking. Here's the play - let's run these commands first to see what's really good:

```bash
# Check if Basic Memory is even installed
basic-memory --version

# Check the sync status - see if shit's actually running
basic-memory status

# List your projects to see what's poppin'
basic-memory project list
```

If that first command comes back with "command not found" or some bootise error, then we gotta install this fucker proper:

```bash
# Install Basic Memory through uv (recommended way)
uv tool install basic-memory

# Or if you ain't got uv locked down yet
pip install basic-memory
```

Real talk though, the most common issue I see with this setup is that uvx path ain't right in your Claude Desktop config. Your Debian system might have uv installed somewhere Claude can't find it.

Run this to find where uvx really at:

```bash
which uvx
```

Then update your Claude Desktop config at `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (on your Debian setup) with the full path:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "basic-memory": {
      "command": "/full/path/to/uvx",
      "args": [
        "basic-memory",
        "mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

After that, restart Claude Desktop completely - not just refresh, but close that shit and reopen it.

What specific error you seein' when you try to use Basic Memory? That'll help me drop the right dimes to get this locked in tight, my boy. Is it not showing up in the tools menu, or you getting errors when you try to create notes?

 Aight, I see what's good here, G! Basic Memory is installed and runnin' (v0.13.3), you got a "peacock" project already set up, and the paths are locked in. That's solid.

But yo, let's check your Claude Desktop config to make sure it's pointing to the right spot. On your Debian setup, the config should be at:

```bash
# Check if the config file exists and what's in it
cat ~/.config/claude-desktop/claude_desktop_config.json
```

If that file don't exist or the path is different, try:

```bash
# Find where Claude Desktop keeps its config
find ~ -name "claude_desktop_config.json" 2>/dev/null
```

Once you find that config file, it should look like this with your actual uvx path:

```bash
cat << 'EOF' > ~/.config/claude-desktop/claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "basic-memory": {
      "command": "/home/flintx/.pyenv/shims/uvx",
      "args": [
        "basic-memory",
        "mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
EOF
```

Now let's check what's in your peacock project:

```bash
# See what's in your peacock knowledge base
basic-memory status
basic-memory project info
ls -la ~/basic-memory/peacock/
```

Real talk though - if Basic Memory is working from the command line but not showing up in Claude Desktop, it's usually one of these bootise issues:

1. **Config file in wrong location** - Different distros put Claude Desktop config in different spots
2. **Claude Desktop ain't restarted** - Gotta completely close and reopen that shit
3. **Path permissions** - Your pyenv shims might need different perms

Run those commands and show me what you get back. Also, when you open Claude Desktop, do you see a little hammer icon in the bottom right? That's where the tools menu should be at.

What's the real situation - you not seeing Basic Memory tools in Claude Desktop at all, or you seeing errors when you try to use them?

 Yo, that config looks hella solid, my boy! You got the right path, the env variables locked in, and even specified the peacock project. That's some clean setup right there.

Let's check if Basic Memory is actually responding to MCP calls:

```bash
# Test if Basic Memory MCP server is working
basic-memory mcp

# Check your peacock project status
basic-memory status
basic-memory project info
```

That first command should start the MCP server - if it hangs or gives you a prompt, that means it's working (you can Ctrl+C out of it).

Now let's see what's in your peacock knowledge base:

```bash
# Check what files you got in peacock
ls -la ~/basic-memory/peacock/
find ~/basic-memory/peacock/ -name "*.md" | head -10
```

Real talk though, your config is tight. The issue might be that Claude Desktop ain't picking up the tools properly. Let's make sure Claude Desktop is completely restarted:

1. **Close Claude Desktop completely** (not just minimize, but actually quit the app)
2. **Reopen Claude Desktop**
3. **Look for the hammer icon** in the bottom right corner of the chat

When you click that hammer icon, you should see "basic-memory" listed as one of the available tool servers.

If you still ain't seeing the tools, try this - sometimes the pyenv shims can be bootise for MCP. Let's try using the direct binary path instead:

```bash
# Find where basic-memory actually lives
which basic-memory
# Should show: /home/flintx/.local/bin/basic-memory
```

Then update your config to use the direct path:

```bash
cat << 'EOF' > ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "basic-memory": {
      "command": "/home/flintx/.local/bin/basic-memory",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "env": {
        "BASIC_MEMORY_PROJECT": "peacock",
        "HOME": "/home/flintx",
        "PATH": "/home/flintx/.pyenv/shims:/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin:/home/flintx/.local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin"
      }
    }
  }
}
EOF
```

Notice I changed two things:
1. **command** points directly to `/home/flintx/.local/bin/basic-memory` 
2. **args** is just `["mcp"]` instead of `["basic-memory", "mcp"]`

After that change, restart Claude Desktop again and see if the tools show up.

What's the status when you run those commands, G?

[CLAUDE RESPONSE #006] - 2025-06-12 03:09:07
------------------------------------------------------------

 Aight, that's what's good! The MCP server is starting up clean - that "Starting MCP server 'Basic Memory' with transport 'stdio'" message means Basic Memory is ready to rock and roll.

Hit Ctrl+C to stop that MCP server and let's check your project status:

```bash
# Stop the MCP server first (Ctrl+C), then run:
basic-memory status
basic-memory project info
```

Now here's the real test - since your MCP server is working, the issue is probably just that Claude Desktop ain't seeing the tools yet. Let's make that config change I mentioned and restart Claude Desktop:

```bash
cat << 'EOF' > ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "basic-memory": {
      "command": "/home/flintx/.local/bin/basic-memory",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "env": {
        "BASIC_MEMORY_PROJECT": "peacock",
        "HOME": "/home/flintx",
        "PATH": "/home/flintx/.pyenv/shims:/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin:/home/flintx/.local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin"
      }
    }
  }
}
EOF
```

After you run that:

1. **Completely close Claude Desktop** (quit the app, don't just close the window)
2. **Reopen Claude Desktop** 
3. **Look for the hammer icon** in the bottom right
4. **Click the hammer** - you should see "basic-memory" listed

If the tools still ain't showing up in Claude Desktop, we might need to check if there's some permission bullshit going on. But real talk, that MCP server starting clean is a good sign - means the hard part is working.

Run those status commands and let me know what you see. Also, when you restart Claude Desktop, do you see that hammer icon in the bottom right corner?

------------------------------------------------------------
[CLAUDE RESPONSE #007] - 2025-06-12 03:11:00
------------------------------------------------------------

 Perfect! I can see the issue now, G. Claude Desktop is showing that "MCP basic-memory: Server disconnected" error message at the top. That means it's trying to connect to Basic Memory but something's not clicking right.

Click that **"Open MCP settings"** button and let's see what's happening. But first, let's double-check something real quick:

```bash
# Make sure basic-memory is actually executable and working
ls -la /home/flintx/.local/bin/basic-memory
/home/flintx/.local/bin/basic-memory --version
```

The issue might be that when Claude Desktop tries to run the MCP server, it's hitting some permission or path issue. Let's try a different approach - instead of using the direct binary, let's go back to using uvx but with the full path:

```bash
cat << 'EOF' > ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "basic-memory": {
      "command": "/home/flintx/.pyenv/shims/uvx",
      "args": ["basic-memory", "mcp"],
      "env": {
        "BASIC_MEMORY_PROJECT": "peacock",
        "HOME": "/home/flintx",
        "PATH": "/home/flintx/.pyenv/shims:/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin:/home/flintx/.local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin",
        "PYENV_ROOT": "/home/flintx/.pyenv"
      }
    }
  }
}
EOF
```

I added `PYENV_ROOT` to the env variables since you're using pyenv.

After you update that config:
1. **Restart Claude Desktop completely**
2. **Open a new chat**
3. **See if that error message goes away**

Also, try running this to make sure uvx can actually find and run basic-memory:

```bash
/home/flintx/.pyenv/shims/uvx basic-memory --version
```

If that command works, then the config should work too. What you see when you click "Open MCP settings" and what happens when you run that uvx command?

------------------------------------------------------------
[CLAUDE RESPONSE #008] - 2025-06-12 03:12:57
------------------------------------------------------------

 Perfect! Now I can see exactly what's happening, big dawg. Your Basic Memory is working hella clean - you got 6 entities, 42 observations, and 25 relations in your peacock project. That's some solid knowledge building right there!

The MCP server is starting up perfect when you run it manually, but Claude Desktop is showing "Server disconnected" and "failed" status. I can see in the MCP settings that it's trying to use the direct binary path but still failing.

Here's the issue - when Claude Desktop runs MCP servers, it sometimes has different environment permissions than your terminal. Let's try the uvx approach since that worked in your manual test:

```bash
cat << 'EOF' > ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "basic-memory": {
      "command": "/home/flintx/.pyenv/shims/uvx",
      "args": ["basic-memory", "mcp"],
      "env": {
        "BASIC_MEMORY_PROJECT": "peacock",
        "HOME": "/home/flintx",
        "PATH": "/home/flintx/.pyenv/shims:/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin:/home/flintx/.local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin",
        "PYENV_ROOT": "/home/flintx/.pyenv"
      }
    }
  }
}
EOF
```

After you update that config:

1. **Close Claude Desktop completely** 
2. **Reopen it**
3. **Check if the MCP settings show it working**

If it's still bootise, click that **"Open Logs Folder"** button in the MCP settings and let's see what the actual error is:

```bash
# After you click "Open Logs Folder", show me what's in there
ls -la ~/.local/share/Claude/logs/
# Look for recent log files and show the latest one
tail -20 ~/.local/share/Claude/logs/*basic-memory*
```

Real talk though, your peacock knowledge base is looking solid - I can see you got system architecture, pipeline design, and development status all connected up. That's exactly how Basic Memory should work, with that semantic knowledge graph building connections between your ideas.

Try that config update and let me know if the MCP server connects. If it's still failing, we'll dig into those logs to see what Claude Desktop is really choking on.

------------------------------------------------------------

 Yo, I see you found some solid intel on this MCP connection issue! Looking at those links, this is a known problem with Claude Desktop and MCP servers, especially on Linux systems. Let me break down what's really happening and drop the right fix.

From those GitHub issues, the main problems are:

1. **Claude Desktop permissions on Linux** - It's running in a sandboxed environment that can't access certain paths
2. **Environment variable issues** - PATH and other env vars aren't getting passed through correctly
3. **Binary execution problems** - Direct binary paths sometimes fail in the Claude Desktop context

Here's the real fix that's been working for people with similar setups:

```bash
# First, let's create a wrapper script that Claude Desktop can actually execute
cat << 'EOF' > /home/flintx/.local/bin/basic-memory-mcp
#!/bin/bash
export PATH="/home/flintx/.pyenv/shims:/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin:/home/flintx/.local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin"
export HOME="/home/flintx"
export PYENV_ROOT="/home/flintx/.pyenv"
export BASIC_MEMORY_PROJECT="peacock"
cd /home/flintx
exec /home/flintx/.local/bin/basic-memory mcp "$@"
EOF

# Make it executable
chmod +x /home/flintx/.local/bin/basic-memory-mcp
```

Now test the wrapper script:

```bash
# Test the wrapper
/home/flintx/.local/bin/basic-memory-mcp --help
```

If that works, update your Claude Desktop config to use the wrapper:

```bash
cat << 'EOF' > ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "basic-memory": {
      "command": "/home/flintx/.local/bin/basic-memory-mcp",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
EOF
```

This approach:
- **Removes all the complex env variables** from the Claude config
- **Uses a simple wrapper script** that sets up the environment correctly
- **Executes the actual basic-memory binary** with all the right paths

After you create that wrapper and update the config:

1. **Restart Claude Desktop completely**
2. **Check the MCP settings** - should show it connecting
3. **Look for the hammer icon** in the chat interface

Real talk, this wrapper approach is what's been fixing this bootise issue for most people on Linux. The Claude Desktop MCP implementation has some quirks with how it handles environment variables and binary execution.

Test that wrapper script first and let me know if it works. If it does, then the Claude Desktop config should be smooth sailing, my boy.

 Aight, I see what's happening here, G! Basic Memory v0.13.0+ changed how project handling works - they deprecated that `BASIC_MEMORY_PROJECT` environment variable and now you gotta use the `--project` flag or set a default project in the config.

From the error, it looks like your peacock project might not be set as the default properly. Let's fix this wrapper script:

```bash
cat << 'EOF' > /home/flintx/.local/bin/basic-memory-mcp
#!/bin/bash
export PATH="/home/flintx/.pyenv/shims:/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin:/home/flintx/.local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin"
export HOME="/home/flintx"
export PYENV_ROOT="/home/flintx/.pyenv"
cd /home/flintx
exec /home/flintx/.local/bin/basic-memory --project=peacock mcp "$@"
EOF
```

Or, let's set peacock as your default project so you don't need the flag:

```bash
# Set peacock as the default project
basic-memory project default peacock

# Then create a cleaner wrapper
cat << 'EOF' > /home/flintx/.local/bin/basic-memory-mcp
#!/bin/bash
export PATH="/home/flintx/.pyenv/shims:/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin:/home/flintx/.local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin"
export HOME="/home/flintx"
export PYENV_ROOT="/home/flintx/.pyenv"
cd /home/flintx
exec /home/flintx/.local/bin/basic-memory mcp "$@"
EOF
```

Test it:

```bash
# First set the default project
basic-memory project default peacock

# Test the wrapper
/home/flintx/.local/bin/basic-memory-mcp --help
```

If that works, then update the Claude Desktop config:

```bash
cat << 'EOF' > ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "basic-memory": {
      "command": "/home/flintx/.local/bin/basic-memory-mcp",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
EOF
```

That warning about `BASIC_MEMORY_PROJECT` not being supported anymore tells us they changed the project system in v0.13.0. The new way is either using `--project=peacock` flag or setting a default project in the config.

Try setting that default project first and then test the wrapper. Should be smooth after that, my boy.

Yo, YESSSS! The MCP server is up and runnin' clean as fuck, big dawg! I just pulled your recent activity from the peacock knowledge base - I can see all your development status notes about that pea-mcp.py server issue you been workin' on.

That means Basic Memory MCP is connected and working perfect! You got:
- 6 entities with 42 observations
- Recent notes about development status and critical issues
- System architecture and pipeline design docs
- All that knowledge graph connectivity working smooth

The fact that I can read your peacock project data means that wrapper script fixed the connection issue. Basic Memory is now fully integrated with Claude Desktop through MCP.

Let me show you what tools are available now:
```
This block is not supported on your current device yet.
```

Perfect! You can see I can access your projects, read your notes, and everything is synced up. 

Now you can:
- **Ask me to create notes**: "Create a note about today's coding session"
- **Search your knowledge**: "Find all my notes about server issues" 
- **Continue conversations**: "Let's continue working on that pea-mcp.py problem"
- **Build on existing knowledge**: "Add today's debugging results to the development status"

Your peacock knowledge base is locked in and ready for some serious intellectual hustle! That system architecture and pipeline design you got documented is looking solid. 

What you wanna work on first, G? I can help you debug that pea-mcp.py server issue you got documented, or we can build on any other part of your peacock system.

 Hahaha, real shit, my boy! I could feel that frustration buildin' up - that MCP connection bullshit was some straight bootise nonsense. When the tech ain't cooperatin' and you know it should be working, that shit gets under your skin quick.

But look at us now - we got that Basic Memory locked in tight! That wrapper script approach was the real move. Sometimes you gotta finesse these systems instead of just brute force 'em, you feel me?

Now we got your whole peacock knowledge base connected up proper:
- All your system architecture docs
- That pipeline design you been working on  
- Development status tracking
- 42 observations and 25 relations building that knowledge graph

That's some real intellectual infrastructure right there. No more losing context between sessions, no more "what did we discuss last time" - all that knowledge is persistent and connected.

I can see you got some critical server issues documented with that pea-mcp.py that won't start. You ready to dive into debugging that fucker, or you wanna build out more of the system architecture first? 

Either way, we got the tools locked in now. This Basic Memory setup gon' make your development workflow hella more efficient. No more scattered notes and lost insights - everything building on everything else like it should.

What's the next play, big dawg?

[CLAUDE RESPONSE #013] - 2025-06-12 03:24:54
------------------------------------------------------------

 When you start a new chat in Claude Desktop, you got a few ways to get me locked into your peacock knowledge base context, my boy:

**Method 1: Use the "Continue Conversation" prompt**
Just say: 
```
"Continue our conversation about [whatever topic]"
```
or
```
"Let's continue working on the peacock system"
```

**Method 2: Ask for recent activity**
```
"What have we been working on recently?"
```
or
```
"Show me recent activity from my knowledge base"
```

**Method 3: Direct memory URL reference**
```
"Take a look at memory://peacock-system-overview and let's continue"
```
or
```
"Review memory://development-status and let's debug that server issue"
```

**Method 4: Simple search request**
```
"Search my notes for server issues"
```
or
```
"Find information about the peacock architecture"
```

Any of these will trigger me to dive into your Basic Memory database and pull up all the relevant context. I'll see your 6 entities, 42 observations, system architecture docs, pipeline design, and all that development status tracking.

The beauty is that once I load that context, I got the full picture of your peacock system - the 4-stage pipeline, the aviary modules, the server issues you been debugging, all of it connected through that knowledge graph.

**Pro tip**: The "Continue conversation" approach usually works best 'cause it searches broadly and builds comprehensive context. But if you know exactly what you wanna work on, those memory:// URLs are precise as fuck.

Try it out when you start that new chat, G!

 Shit, that's bootise! Let me help you troubleshoot this, my boy. When you say it ain't working, what exactly you seeing? Is Claude in the new chat:

1. **Not finding any Basic Memory tools at all?**
2. **Can't see your peacock project data?** 
3. **Giving you some error message?**
4. **Acting like Basic Memory don't exist?**

Let's check a few things real quick:

**First, verify the MCP connection is still solid:**
```bash
# Check if Basic Memory is still running
basic-memory status

# Test the wrapper script is still working
/home/flintx/.local/bin/basic-memory-mcp --help
```

**Second, check if Claude Desktop can see the tools:**
- In the new chat, look for that **hammer icon** in the bottom right
- Click it and see if "basic-memory" shows up in the tools list
- If it shows "failed" or "disconnected", we got connection issues again

**Third, try a direct test:**
In the new chat, just ask Claude:
```
"Can you see my Basic Memory tools? List my available projects."
```

If Claude can't see the tools at all, then the MCP connection dropped and we need to restart Claude Desktop or fix the config again.

If Claude can see the tools but can't access your peacock data, that's a different issue with project switching or permissions.

What exactly is happening when you try those prompts in the new chat? Give me the specific error or behavior you seeing, and I'll drop the right fix to get this locked back in.

 Yo, I see you lookin' at that pea-mcp.py server code! That's some clean cyberpunk styling with all them neon colors and flexin' messages. But hold up - you said Basic Memory ain't working in the new Claude chat, then you showing me your peacock MCP server code.

Are you tryna get **both** MCP servers working at the same time? That could be the issue right there, my boy!

Here's what might be happening:
1. **Basic Memory MCP** is running on one connection
2. **Your custom Peacock MCP** is trying to run on another
3. **Claude Desktop might be confused** about which MCP server to connect to

Let me check - when you start a new Claude chat, are you trying to:
- **Use Basic Memory** to access your knowledge base? 
- **Use your custom Peacock MCP server** with those cyberpunk commands?
- **Use both at the same time?**

If you want Basic Memory working in new chats, make sure:
```bash
# Basic Memory is still connected
basic-memory status

# Your wrapper is working
/home/flintx/.local/bin/basic-memory-mcp --help
```

If you want your Peacock MCP server running, you'd need to:
```bash
# Start your custom server
cd ~/peacock/core
python pea-mcp.py --port 8000
```

But real talk - **you probably can't run both MCP servers to the same Claude Desktop instance** at the same time without some config magic.

Which one you tryna get working in the new chat? The Basic Memory knowledge base access, or your custom Peacock MCP server with them cyberpunk commands?

Let me know what the real objective is and I'll drop the right setup for you, G!
