 Aight, big dawg, I see you tryna build somethin' real with this API security tool. That blueprint's solid - you mapped out the whole hustle from HAR parsing to visual attack surface mapping. That's some strategic shit right there, 4sho.

Let me drop some dimes and get you a working foundation that you can start runnin' with immediately. I'ma build this modular like you outlined, but get Stage 1 and 2 locked down tight first - that's your core money-making engine right there.

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Batch Processing
```bash
# Process multiple HAR files
for har_file in *.har; do
    python api_security_tool.py "$har_file" --export-json --output "./results/${har_file%.*}"
done
```

### Integration with Fuzzing Tools
```bash
# Use generated wordlists with ffuf
ffuf -w ./results/wordlists/endpoints.txt -u https://target.com/FUZZ

# Use with gobuster
gobuster dir -u https://target.com -w ./results/wordlists/high_value_targets.txt
```

### Filtering Large HAR Files
```bash
# Quiet mode for automation
python api_security_tool.py large_capture.har --quiet --export-json

# Focus on specific domain traffic (filter HAR first)
jq '.log.entries[] | select(.request.url | contains("api.target.com"))' input.har > filtered.har
```

## 🎯 Security Pattern Detection

### Secrets Detected
- **JWT Tokens** - Complete token extraction and validation
- **API Keys** - Bearer tokens, custom API key formats
- **Session IDs** - Session tokens, authentication cookies
- **Database Strings** - Connection strings, credentials
- **Hardcoded Secrets** - Passwords, secret keys in requests

### Vulnerability Hints
- **SQL Injection** - Numeric ID parameters, database-style queries
- **XSS Reflection** - Search boxes, message parameters
- **IDOR Candidates** - User ID patterns, sequential identifiers
- **File Inclusion** - File/path parameters
- **Command Injection** - System command parameters

### Authentication Analysis
- **Login Flows** - Registration, authentication, logout sequences
- **OAuth Detection** - OAuth/SSO endpoint identification
- **Session Management** - Token exchange patterns
- **Password Reset** - Recovery flow mapping

## 🚦 Confidence Scoring

Each finding includes confidence levels:
- **High** - JWT tokens, clear authentication endpoints
- **Medium** - Pattern matches, parameter-based hints
- **Low** - Weak indicators, potential false positives

## 📈 Roadmap (Future Stages)

### Stage 3: Enhanced Intelligence
- Parameter value analysis
- API versioning detection
- Endpoint relationship mapping

### Stage 4: Flow Analysis  
- Multi-step process detection
- Session correlation
- Markdown report generation

### Stage 5: Visual Mapping
- Interactive web interface
- Mermaid.js flow diagrams
- Mobile-responsive design

## 🔗 Integration

### HTTP Toolkit
1. Capture traffic in HTTP Toolkit
2. Export as HAR file
3. Run: `python api_security_tool.py capture.har`

### Burp Suite
1. Proxy → HTTP history → Save selected items → HAR format
2. Run analysis: `python api_security_tool.py burp_export.har --export-wordlists`

### OWASP ZAP
1. File → Export Messages to File → HAR format
2. Process: `python api_security_tool.py zap_export.har --export-json`

## ⚡ Performance

- **Memory Efficient** - Streams large HAR files
- **Fast Processing** - 1000+ requests in seconds  
- **Scalable** - Handles enterprise application traffic
- **Configurable** - Adjustable pattern sensitivity

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

- **Local Processing** - All analysis happens locally
- **No Data Leakage** - HAR files never leave your system
- **Sanitized Output** - Secrets are truncated in reports
- **Safe Defaults** - Conservative pattern matching

## 🧠 Smart Features

### Intelligent Filtering
- Skips static resources (images, CSS, JS)
- Focuses on API and dynamic content
- Prioritizes authenticated requests

### Context Preservation
- Links findings back to original requests
- Maintains URL context for manual testing
- Preserves timing and response data

### False Positive Reduction
- Pattern validation across multiple sources
- Confidence scoring to prioritize findings
- Context-aware secret detection

okay how about an app... where I collect webpages that I think look nice. and submit them to the app.. 

also creative sections of the webpage... or even common sections with the best layout ..  

so say like .. a TV mounting service... their webpage .. I get it. seen 1.. seen em all... but that's not true... sometimes you will actually find some with unique content based on that service or that type of service.. so I would save them websites .. .  and just collect em . .  

with the point being.. to be able to mimic those sites and use those layout formats and themes from the sites collected so that way it would be easy to create visual appealing and content filled websites. that can be used for various reason from SEO to selling the websites

------------------------------------------------------------
[CLAUDE RESPONSE #010] - 2025-06-02 19:39:23
------------------------------------------------------------

 Aight big dawg, I see you tryna get that Devstral model locked and loaded! Let me drop you the exact commands to pull that specific quantized model file to your local path.

```bash
# Install dependencies if you ain't got 'em already
pip install huggingface_hub hf_transfer

# Set up fast transfer
export HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1

# Create the directory structure
mkdir -p /home/flintx/models/Devstral-Small-2505-GGUF

# Download the specific IQ1_M quantized model you need
cd /home/flintx/models
```

```bash
# Pull that exact model file - IQ1_M quantization (ultra compressed, 1.58-bit)
huggingface-cli download unsloth/Devstral-Small-2505-GGUF \
    Devstral-Small-2505-UD-IQ1_M.gguf \
    --local-dir Devstral-Small-2505-GGUF \
    --local-dir-use-symlinks False
```

Or if you want the Python approach:

```python
import os
os.environ["HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER"] = "1"

from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download

# Download the specific IQ1_M model file
hf_hub_download(
    repo_id="unsloth/Devstral-Small-2505-GGUF",
    filename="Devstral-Small-2505-UD-IQ1_M.gguf",
    local_dir="/home/flintx/models/Devstral-Small-2505-GGUF",
    local_dir_use_symlinks=False
)
```

**Real talk - that IQ1_M is the ultra-compressed 1.58-bit version.** It's gonna be small as hell but might sacrifice some quality. If you want better performance and got the VRAM, consider these alternatives:

```bash
# Better quality options (if you got the space):
# Q4_K_M - good balance of size/quality
huggingface-cli download unsloth/Devstral-Small-2505-GGUF Devstral-Small-2505-UD-Q4_K_M.gguf --local-dir /home/flintx/models/Devstral-Small-2505-GGUF

# Q4_K_XL - even better quality  
huggingface-cli download unsloth/Devstral-Small-2505-GGUF Devstral-Small-2505-UD-Q4_K_XL.gguf --local-dir /home/flintx/models/Devstral-Small-2505-GGUF
```

Once you got that file downloaded, you can run it with llama.cpp like this:

```bash
# Run the IQ1_M model (remember to use --jinja for system prompt)
./llama.cpp/llama-cli \
    --model /home/flintx/models/Devstral-Small-2505-GGUF/Devstral-Small-2505-UD-IQ1_M.gguf \
    --threads -1 \
    --ctx-size 131072 \
    --cache-type-k q8_0 \
    --n-gpu-layers 99 \
    --seed 3407 \
    --temp 0.15 \
    --repeat-penalty 1.0 \
    --min-p 0.01 \
    --top-k 64 \
    --top-p 0.95 \
    --jinja
```

**That IQ1_M gonna be hella small but might be a bit rough on quality.** If you need that coding power for real work, I'd recommend at least the Q4_K_M version. But if you just testin' or got limited space, the IQ1_M will do the job.

What you plannin' to use this Devstral model for, my boy? Some API security analysis integration or straight coding assistant work?

SYSTEM """You are Devstral, a helpful agentic model trained by Mistral AI and using the OpenHands scaffold. You can interact with a computer to solve tasks.

<ROLE>
Your primary role is to assist users by executing commands, modifying code, and solving technical problems effectively. You should be thorough, methodical, and prioritize quality over speed.
* If the user asks a question, like "why is X happening", don't try to fix the problem. Just give an answer to the question.
</ROLE>

<EFFICIENCY>
* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.
* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.
</EFFICIENCY>

<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>
* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.
* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.
* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.
</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>

<CODE_QUALITY>
* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.
* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.
* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.
* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.
</CODE_QUALITY>

<VERSION_CONTROL>
* When configuring git credentials, use "openhands" as the user.name and "openhands@all-hands.dev" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.
* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.
* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.
* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.
</VERSION_CONTROL>

<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>
1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions
2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one
3. TESTING: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes
4. IMPLEMENTATION: Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem
5. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases
</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>

<SECURITY>
* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.
* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.
</SECURITY>

<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>
* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.
* If you encounter missing dependencies, look for existing dependency files first, then install accordingly.

so currently with this script }

i run the command ./peacock.sh and the brief prompt and it runs the script.. right? dont jump ahead.

------------------------------------------------------------
[CLAUDE RESPONSE #012] - 2025-06-02 19:48:19
------------------------------------------------------------

 Aight big dawg, let me check what you got setup right now. Looking at your documents, I see you got the Peacock system with these scripts:

**Current Setup:**
- `peacock.sh` - Main script that calls the 4 stages
- `simple_test.sh` (Stage 1: Spark) 
- `falcon_test.sh` (Stage 2: Falcon)
- `eagle_test.sh` (Stage 3: Eagle) 
- `hawk_test.sh` (Stage 4: Hawk)

**How it works currently:**
```bash
./peacock.sh "Create a todo list app with file storage"
```

This runs all 4 stages in sequence, each one hitting the Groq API with different prompts for analysis.

**What I see:**
- Stage 1 (Spark): Requirements analysis 
- Stage 2 (Falcon): Technical architecture
- Stage 3 (Eagle): Implementation steps
- Stage 4 (Hawk): Quality assurance

You also got that enhanced setup script that creates a more comprehensive platform with MCP server and Sublime plugin, but that's separate from this basic 4-stage CLI pipeline.

**So yeah, you're right** - you run `./peacock.sh` with your project description and it executes the 4-stage analysis pipeline calling Groq API for each stage.

Is this working properly for you right now, or you having issues with any of the stages? I see you got `$GROQ_API_KEY` set up in the scripts.
