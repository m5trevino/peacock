Bet, I can see your conversation history in the Peacock Memory, G. Got hella convos stored up in there - looks like you been droppin' questions and workin' on some tech projects. I'm seein' everything from terminal hotkey overlay architecture to document processing instructions and some Gemini AI comparisons.

What's real though - you want me to pull up somethin' specific from those conversations, or you just checkin' to see if the memory system's locked and loaded? I can dig deeper into any of these threads if you need me to refresh on what we been buildin' together.

What you need, big dawg?

**BASED ON THIS FILE, GRID-NODE FIRST MENTIONED ON:**

**June 8, 2025** - That's the earliest date I see in the "Peacock AI Platform Overview" document.

**START WITH THE 2025-06-08 CONVERSATION** - That's where you need to pick up from to see the original grid-node vision and how it evolved into the current peacock system.

 **YOU'RE RIGHT, BIG DAWG!** 

**I DON'T SEE "GRID-NODE" IN THAT 2025-06-08 CONVERSATION EITHER.**

**LET ME SEARCH MORE SPECIFICALLY:**

**LOOKS LIKE GRID-NODE IS MENTIONED IN THIS CONVO ON JUNE 25, 2025:**

**"Peacock Development System Strategy" - Created 2025-06-25**

**The specific mention says:**
"well maybe grid-node can be developed right now..."

**BUT I DON'T SEE THE ACTUAL FIRST MENTION OR FULL CONTEXT OF GRID-NODE.**

**LET ME CHECK THE JUNE 25 CONVERSATION TO SEE THE FULL CONTEXT:**

**BIG DAWG, THIS FILE IS FROM JULY 4TH 2025 - IT'S A README CONVERSATION, NOT THE JUNE 25TH GRID-NODE CONVERSATION!**

**I NEED TO FIND THE ACTUAL JUNE 25TH CONVERSATION WHERE YOU FIRST MENTIONED GRID-NODE.**

**LET ME SEARCH FOR THE EXACT JUNE 25TH CONVERSATION:**
