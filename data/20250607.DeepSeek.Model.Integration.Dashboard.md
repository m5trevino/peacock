Aight big dawg, I got the full picture now! Let me drop them dimes on both requests - converting everything to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B and building that fire AI Model Dashboard. 🔥

**COMMANDS FIRST - NO BULLSHIT:**

```bash
# Update enhanced_mcp_server.py to use DeepSeek
sed -i 's/GROQ_MODEL_NAME = .*/GROQ_MODEL_NAME = "deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b"/' enhanced_mcp_server.py

# Update peacock_model_selector.py to prioritize DeepSeek
sed -i '/groq.*models.*=/,/]/ {
    s/qwen-qwq-32b/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b/
    s/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b.*,/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b",/
    /deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b/ { i\                    "deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b",

i aint feeling it we ned to go back to the original.. i spent a lot of time with th elayout and the setup.. we need to go back to it.

------------------------------------------------------------
[CLAUDE RESPONSE #005] - 2025-06-07 03:15:18
------------------------------------------------------------

 Yo, I feel you big dawg! 💯 You put hella work into that original setup and we bout to fuck with perfection. Let me get us back to your original fire and just switch out the models to DeepSeek like you wanted.

**COMMANDS FIRST - KEEPING YOUR ORIGINAL HEAT:**

```bash
# Just update the model names in your existing files
sed -i 's/GROQ_MODEL_NAME = "qwen-qwq-32b"/GROQ_MODEL_NAME = "deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b"/' enhanced_mcp_server.py

# Add DeepSeek optimal settings to your existing server
sed -i '/GROQ_MODEL_NAME = /a\
\
# DEEPSEEK OPTIMAL SETTINGS\
DEEPSEEK_TEMPERATURE = 0.6  # Optimal for reasoning models\
DEEPSEEK_MAX_TOKENS = 8192  # High context for complex reasoning\
DEEPSEEK_TOP_P = 0.8        # Balanced creativity/precision' enhanced_mcp_server.py

# Update the call_llm function to use DeepSeek settings
sed -i '/temperature=0.1/c\
            temperature=DEEPSEEK_TEMPERATURE,' enhanced_mcp_server.py

sed -i '/temperature=DEEPSEEK_TEMPERATURE,/a\
            max_tokens=DEEPSEEK_MAX_TOKENS,\
            top_p=DEEPSEEK_TOP_P' enhanced_mcp_server.py
```

**Your original peacock_model_selector.py just needs DeepSeek prioritized:**

```bash
# Move DeepSeek to the top of the Groq models list
sed -i '/groq.*models.*=/,/]/ {
    /qwen-qwq-32b/i\                    "deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b",
    /qwen-qwq-32b/d
}' peacock_model_selector.py
```

**Just add the deployment button to your existing XEdit interface:**
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```

**What I'm doing here is RESPECTING your original work, my boy! 🔥**

## **KEEPING YOUR FIRE INTACT:**

1. **Your enhanced_mcp_server.py** - Just switching the model name and adding DeepSeek optimal settings
2. **Your peacock_xedit_interface.html** - Just adding the deploy section, keeping all your layout work
3. **Your model selector** - Just prioritizing DeepSeek in the existing list
4. **Your API handlers** - Zero changes, they already work perfect

## **MINIMAL CHANGES FOR MAXIMUM GAIN:**

- **Model**: `qwen-qwq-32b` → `deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b`  
- **Temperature**: `0.1` → `0.6` (optimal for reasoning)
- **Max tokens**: Added `8192` for complex reasoning
- **Deploy button**: Clean addition to your existing interface

## **YOUR ORIGINAL ARCHITECTURE STAYS FIRE:**

- ✅ 4-stage pipeline (Spark → Falcon → Eagle → Hawk)
- ✅ XEdit-Path system with 7x001 IDs  
- ✅ HTML report generation
- ✅ Debug logging system
- ✅ Interface generation workflow

**All I'm doing is swapping the engine from a V6 to a V8 - same car, more power! 💪**

Your original layout and structure was hella clean, big dawg. No need to reinvent the wheel when we just need to upgrade the motor to DeepSeek reasoning power. 🦚⚡

Ready to keep your original fire and just boost it with DeepSeek? That's the smart play! 4sho! 🔥

[USER ENTRY #006] - 2025-06-07 03:40:43
============================================================

I'm tired of the long as names . Let's do like this . For the mcp let's do 

/home/flintx/peacock/core/peamcp.py

For the model dashboard
/home/flintx/peacock/core/moddash.py

For the xedit-path html. 
/home/flintx/peacock/core/xedit.py



Please put flag options on the co for logs. Logs consist of files saved in /home/flintx/peacock/logs/ 

peamcp.py goes to 
 /home/flintx/peacock/logs/mcplog.txt

the log for the prompt generated goes to promptlog.txt

The log for response goes to response.txt

The logging should be maxed out everything all the raw data. 

The flag should be --log or -l 


The logs should end with the week of the the year and the the day of the month and the hour and the min. 

mcplog-23-6-837.txt
And all the logs that are generated from the same sessions the week dosh and time should match to make it easy. ....   


The generated gym files should be saved in /home/flintx/peacock/http/moddash-23-6-839.txt
And xedit.html-23-6-839.html

Make sense?

------------------------------------------------------------
[CLAUDE RESPONSE #006] - 2025-06-07 03:42:26
------------------------------------------------------------

 Hell yeah, that makes perfect sense, big dawg! 🔥 Clean, short names and organized logging. Let me drop them dimes on this streamlined setup.

**COMMANDS FIRST - CLEAN STRUCTURE:**

```bash
# Create the clean directory structure
mkdir -p /home/flintx/peacock/core
mkdir -p /home/flintx/peacock/logs  
mkdir -p /home/flintx/peacock/html

# Move and rename your existing files
cp enhanced_mcp_server.py /home/flintx/peacock/core/peamcp.py
cp peacock_model_dashboard.py /home/flintx/peacock/core/moddash.py
cp mockup_xedit_generator.py /home/flintx/peacock/core/xedit.py
```

Now let me rebuild these with your clean naming and logging system:

what is going on with this what am i souposed to do? 

*# Create the clean directory structure* mkdir -p /home/flintx/peacock/core mkdir -p /home/flintx/peacock/logs mkdir -p /home/flintx/peacock/html *# Move and rename your existing files* cp enhanced_mcp_server.py /home/flintx/peacock/core/peamcp.py cp peacock_model_dashboard.py /home/flintx/peacock/core/moddash.py cp mockup_xedit_generator.py /home/flintx/peacock/core/xedit.py

i have the files are they the full code or cleaners i dont get it ?

------------------------------------------------------------
[CLAUDE RESPONSE #010] - 2025-06-07 06:01:37
------------------------------------------------------------

 Yo my bad, big dawg! I confused the fuck outta you! 🤦‍♂️

Let me break this down REAL CLEAR:

## **WHAT I GAVE YOU:**

The artifacts I created are **COMPLETE NEW FILES** - not cleaners for your existing files. They're fully rewritten versions with:

1. **Clean names** (peamcp.py instead of enhanced_mcp_server.py)
2. **DeepSeek model** (already switched from qwen-qwq-32b)  
3. **Session logging** (--log flag, timestamped files)
4. **Deploy buttons** (download functionality)

## **WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:**

**Option 1: Use My Complete New Files (RECOMMENDED)**
```bash
# Create the directories
mkdir -p /home/flintx/peacock/core
mkdir -p /home/flintx/peacock/logs  
mkdir -p /home/flintx/peacock/html

# Copy the artifact content I gave you into these new files:
# - Copy the "peamcp.py" artifact content → /home/flintx/peacock/core/peamcp.py
# - Copy the "moddash.py" artifact content → /home/flintx/peacock/core/moddash.py  
# - Copy the "xedit.py" artifact content → /home/flintx/peacock/core/xedit.py
```

**Option 2: Keep Your Original Files and Just Switch Model**
```bash
# Just change the model in your existing enhanced_mcp_server.py
sed -i 's/qwen-qwq-32b/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b/' enhanced_mcp_server.py
```

## **MY RECOMMENDATION:**

**Go with Option 1** - Use my complete new files because they have:
- ✅ DeepSeek already configured
- ✅ Clean logging system with --log flag
- ✅ Session timestamping (23-6-837 format)
- ✅ Deploy download buttons
- ✅ All your original functionality + improvements

**Your choice, my boy!** Want the new clean setup or just quick model swap on your existing files? 💪🔥

**OR QUICKER FIX - Just delete the broken line and add the missing bracket:**

```bash
# Remove the broken line and fix it
sed -i '762d' /home/flintx/peacock/core/peamcp.py
echo "                }" >> /home/flintx/peacock/core/peamcp.py
```

My bad for the incomplete artifact, fucker! 😅 That should fix the syntax error and get your server running. Try it now:

```bash
python3 peamcp.py --log
```

Let me know if it fires up clean! 🔥🦚

**COMMAND TO FIX XEDIT.PY:**

```bash
# Delete the broken file and rebuild it properly
rm /home/flintx/peacock/core/xedit.py

# Create the complete working file
cat > /home/flintx/peacock/core/xedit.py << 'EOF'
#!/usr/bin/env python3

Now test both files:

```bash
python3 peamcp.py --log

And in another terminal:

```bash
python3 xedit.py
```

Should work clean now, my boy! 🔥🦚

 Yo! The HTML files get generated when the server receives requests or when you run the individual generators. Let me show you where they are and how to get them:

**CHECK FOR EXISTING HTML FILES:**

```bash
# Check what's in your html directory
ls -la /home/flintx/peacock/html/

# Look for files with your current session (23-6-2325)
ls -la /home/flintx/peacock/html/*2325*
```

**GENERATE THE HTML FILES MANUALLY:**

```bash
# Generate the XEdit interface (creates xedit-23-6-2325.html)
python3 /home/flintx/peacock/core/xedit.py

# Generate the Model Dashboard (creates moddash-23-6-2325.html)  
python3 /home/flintx/peacock/core/moddash.py
```

**OR TRIGGER THEM VIA THE SERVER:**

Since your server is running on session 23-6-2325, you can trigger HTML generation by making a request:

```bash
# In another terminal, trigger interface generation
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/process \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "command": "peacock_full",
    "text": "build a simple calculator",
    "language": "python"
  }'
```

**THE HTML FILES SHOULD BE HERE:**
```bash
/home/flintx/peacock/html/xedit-23-6-2325.html      # XEdit interface
/home/flintx/peacock/html/moddash-23-6-2325.html    # Model dashboard
```

**QUICK CHECK COMMAND:**
```bash
# Generate both and open them
cd /home/flintx/peacock/core
python3 xedit.py && python3 moddash.py && ls -la /home/flintx/peacock/html/
```

Your server is running perfect with session **23-6-2325** - the HTML files just need to be generated! Run those commands and you'll see them appear with the matching session timestamp. 🔥🦚

Which method you wanna use to generate them, big dawg?

i need a command to change the old api key to this 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

------------------------------------------------------------
[CLAUDE RESPONSE #016] - 2025-06-07 06:29:19
------------------------------------------------------------

 **COMMANDS TO UPDATE THE API KEY:**

```bash
# Update the API key in peamcp.py
sed -i 's/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/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/' /home/flintx/peacock/core/peamcp.py

# Update any other files that might have the old key
sed -i 's/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/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/' /home/flintx/peacock/core/*.py

# If you have an api-key.txt file, update it too
if [ -f /home/flintx/peacock/api-key.txt ]; then
    sed -i 's/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/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/' /home/flintx/peacock/api-key.txt
fi

# Check that it got updated
grep -n "gsk_mKXjkt" /home/flintx/peacock/core/peamcp.py
```

**VERIFY THE CHANGE:**
```bash
# Make sure the old key is gone
grep -r "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" /home/flintx/peacock/core/

# Should show the new key
grep -r "gsk_mKXjkt" /home/flintx/peacock/core/
```

Now restart your server to use the new API key:

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C) then restart
python3 /home/flintx/peacock/core/peamcp.py --log
```

That'll swap out the old key for the new one across all your files, my boy! 🔥🔑

 Yo, absolutely! You need real-time CLI output to see what's happening during the 4-stage pipeline. Let me add that progress monitoring to peamcp.py:

 I understand you want me to use the artifacts feature instead of regular chat since the formatting gets messed up. Let me create the updated peamcp.py file as an artifact:
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```

Perfect! Now copy this artifact content to replace your current peamcp.py file. This version has:

🔥 **Real-time CLI progress** - You'll see exactly when each stage starts/stops
⚡ **Color-coded output** - Blue for starting, yellow for processing, green for success, red for errors  
🦚 **4-stage pipeline** - SPARK → FALCON → EAGLE → HAWK with progress tracking
📊 **Enhanced logging** - Everything gets logged to files with stage info
🎯 **Better error handling** - Shows exactly where failures happen

**To deploy:**
```bash
# Replace your current file with this artifact content
# Then restart:
python3 /home/flintx/peacock/core/peamcp.py --log
```

Now when you hit it with requests, you'll see real-time progress like:
```

let make a copy of the peamcp and the xedit and the moddash and put a-deep at the end of the file name.. 

peamcp-deep.py

and then leave those as ther are and take the copies and change th emodel it   
this model.. 

import json
from pygments import highlight
from pygments.lexers import PythonLexer
from pygments.formatters import HtmlFormatter
# Process API response
response = json.loads(api_response)
# Extract code blocks
code_blocks = []
for message in response["messages"]:
    if message["role"] == "assistant":
        content = message["content"]
        # Detect code blocks using pygments
        lexer = PythonLexer()
        formatter = HtmlFormatter()
        code_block = highlight(content, lexer, formatter)
        code_blocks.append(code_block)
# Print code blocks
for code_block in code_blocks:
    print(code_block)


and lets try to figure out how to use a python parser or some kinda of formatted way that will make it easy to seperate code from the responjse.

[CLAUDE RESPONSE #019] - 2025-06-07 08:36:48

 Yo, let me create those deep copies and add proper code parsing! 🔥

**COMMANDS TO CREATE THE COPIES:**

```bash
# Create the deep copies
cp /home/flintx/peacock/core/peamcp.py /home/flintx/peacock/core/peamcp-deep.py
cp /home/flintx/peacock/core/xedit.py /home/flintx/peacock/core/xedit-deep.py  
cp /home/flintx/peacock/core/moddash.py /home/flintx/peacock/core/moddash-deep.py
```

Now let me create the enhanced peamcp-deep.py with the new model and proper code parsing:
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```

deep is already created w ejust copid it.. 

now we need to use a command to remove the deep seek model and add this 

"llama-3.3-70b-versatile"

wiht a cli command. no need to write al lthe code again.

------------------------------------------------------------
[CLAUDE RESPONSE #020] - 2025-06-07 08:38:30
------------------------------------------------------------

 **COMMANDS TO UPDATE THE MODEL IN ALL DEEP FILES:**

```bash
# Update peamcp-deep.py
sed -i 's/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b/llama-3.3-70b-versatile/' /home/flintx/peacock/core/peamcp-deep.py

# Update xedit-deep.py  
sed -i 's/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b/llama-3.3-70b-versatile/' /home/flintx/peacock/core/xedit-deep.py

# Update moddash-deep.py
sed -i 's/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b/llama-3.3-70b-versatile/' /home/flintx/peacock/core/moddash-deep.py

# Also update any references to "DeepSeek" in the display text
sed -i 's/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B/Llama-3.3-70B-Versatile/g' /home/flintx/peacock/core/*-deep.py
sed -i 's/DeepSeek/Llama-3.3/g' /home/flintx/peacock/core/*-deep.py

# Verify the changes
grep -n "llama-3.3-70b-versatile" /home/flintx/peacock/core/*-deep.py
```

**VERIFY IT WORKED:**
```bash
# Check that the old model is gone
grep -r "deepseek-r1-distill" /home/flintx/peacock/core/*-deep.py

# Should show the new model
grep -r "llama-3.3-70b-versatile" /home/flintx/peacock/core/*-deep.py
```

Now you can test the deep version with Llama instead of DeepSeek:
```bash
python3 /home/flintx/peacock/core/peamcp-deep.py --log
```

That'll swap all the models in your deep copies from DeepSeek to Llama-3.3-70B-Versatile! 🔥🦚

do we want to try and make the response format better so we can maybe poarse it eaiser?

 Hell yeah, big dawg! Looking at that parsing strategy document and your setup, we definitely need to implement better response formatting and parsing. Let me add the enhanced parsing system to your llama files:

**COMMANDS TO SET UP THE ENHANCED PARSING:**

```bash
# Create the llama directory and copy files
mkdir -p /home/flintx/peacock/core/llama
cp /home/flintx/peacock/core/peamcp-deep.py /home/flintx/peacock/core/llama/peamcp-llama.py
cp /home/flintx/peacock/core/xedit-deep.py /home/flintx/peacock/core/llama/xedit-llama.py
cp /home/flintx/peacock/core/moddash-deep.py /home/flintx/peacock/core/llama/moddash-llama.py

# Update model names to llama
sed -i 's/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b/llama-3.3-70b-versatile/g' /home/flintx/peacock/core/llama/*.py
sed -i 's/DeepSeek/Llama-3.3/g' /home/flintx/peacock/core/llama/*.py
```

Now let me create the enhanced peamcp-llama.py with bulletproof parsing:
