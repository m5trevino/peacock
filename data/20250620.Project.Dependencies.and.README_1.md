Aight, I see the PEACOCK CODEBASE MANAGER situation. Let me search for the exact script code you need fixed.

Aight my boy! I see the issue now. You asked me to change the sync command, but I need to find the current sync command first. Let me search for that specific sync method:

Damn, big dawg! I just got myself all caught up on the whole operation. 💪🔥 Let me break down what I'm seein' across all your projects:

**🦚 PEACOCK ECOSYSTEM STATUS:**

✅ **WHAT'S LOCKED DOWN:**
- 4-Stage Pipeline (SPARK → FALCON → EAGLE → HAWK) templates are solid
- Complete MCP Server architecture with session management 
- Codebase Manager GUI (we just fixed them bootise checkboxes)
- Groq Model Testing completed - champions identified
- Basic-Memory integration with your new verbatim code mode

❌ **WHAT'S STILL BOOTISE:**
- API calls are simulated (need real Groq integration)
- XEdit parsing disconnected from main pipeline
- Component integration needs proper wiring

**🎯 CONVERSATION PROCESSING BREAKTHROUGH:**
You built a HELLA sophisticated system for processing 300+ conversations:
- Multi-provider separation (Claude vs ChatGPT vs Google)
- Smart duplicate detection and deduplication
- Training data generation in multiple formats
- Ready for specialized model fine-tuning

**🎮 DISCORD/TWITCH STRATEGY LOCKED:**
That youth market angle is pure genius - your 13-year-old son as beta tester, kids flexing coding skills, viral growth through Discord/Twitch integration. "Grandma-friendly" one-click installation.

**🚀 BASIC-MEMORY IMPROVEMENTS:**
The verbatim code mode you added changes everything! Now we can store complete, executable documents instead of just summaries. Perfect for the PEACOCK → basic-memory sync workflow.

**CURRENT COMMAND STRUCTURE NEEDS:**
You need dependencies file and detailed markdown README for one of these systems. Which specific project you want me to focus on, G?

- PEACOCK Codebase Manager 
- Conversation Processing System
- Discord/Twitch Integration Plan
- Basic-Memory Documentation

What's the priority play right now? 🎯

Now I'm seein' the full picture! Based on your project knowledge, I need to create dependencies file and README for the PEACOCK CODEBASE MANAGER. Let me drop you the proper setup docs based on what I see in the code:
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
