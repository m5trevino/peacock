Let me check that specific conversation from June 4th about groq.com, looks promising:

### **Step 3: Run the Peacock Optimization Tests**

```bash
# Set your API key
export GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key-here"

# Run the Peacock-specific optimization
python peacock_model_optimizer.py
```

### **Step 4: Update Peacock MCP Server**

```bash
# Backup your current server
cp enhanced_mcp_server.py enhanced_mcp_server.py.backup

# Add the optimization code to your server
cat peacock_groq_integration.py >> enhanced_mcp_server.py
```

**This Optimization Will:**

✅ **Test Peacock's EXACT prompts** with the top 3 models  
✅ **Find the best model** for each stage (Spark/Falcon/Eagle/Hawk)  
✅ **Optimize prompt formatting** for maximum parsing success  
✅ **Create fallback logic** for reliability  
✅ **Generate integration code** ready for your MCP server  

**Expected Results Based on Our Analysis:**
- **llama3-8b-8192** should dominate for speed + reliability
- **Parsing scores should be 70-90%** with optimized JSON prompts
- **Response times under 1 second** for all stages

**Once you run this, we'll have:**
1. **Concrete proof** of which model works best for Peacock
2. **Optimized prompts** that maximize parsing success  
3. **Ready-to-implement code** for your MCP server
4. **Fallback strategy** for when models fail

**Ready to see which model becomes Peacock's champion?** 🚀💯

This is gonna give us the EXACT data we need to make Peacock bulletproof!

## Human: i dont have all the keys yet 
remember what we we were trying to do look for the api keys 

i need the groq api keys i posted to you 6 days ago

## Assistant: **YO, MY BAD!** 🤦‍♂️ 

You're absolutely right - we got sidetracked with the optimization when you just need those **Groq API keys you posted 6 days ago**!

Let me search deeper for those keys:
