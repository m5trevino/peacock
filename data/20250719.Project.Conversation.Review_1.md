i need you to use the mcp tool peacock-mem to review our previous conversations so we can continute our project...  there are 4 convos i want you to review very thouroughly.. you will use the mcp tool "conversations" to locate these convos. 

the convos are from most recent to oldest :
URL Extraction Tool Integration
Peacock memory Project Recovery
Peacock Memory Project 
 Legal Filing Emergency 
--------

i need you to go over all the convos but i really need you to look and know the latest one URL Extraction Tool Integration, the reason being is because we went over the exact details of the project you are helping me develop and it cannot deviate from that... 

the part in the convo where you need to pay special attention to is from this point where you mention.... 
 
Looking at your recent conversation, I see what happened:
CURRENT SITUATION:
