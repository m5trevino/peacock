    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    -- Additional fields based on requirements
);

CREATE TABLE [business_entities] (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    -- Complete schema design based on domain requirements
);

-- Indexes for performance optimization
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);

- Data archival and retention policy with compliance considerations

**4. API ARCHITECTURE:**

**RESTful API Design:**
```
# User Management
GET    /api/v1/users              # List users with pagination, filtering, sorting
POST   /api/v1/users              # Create user with comprehensive validation
GET    /api/v1/users/:id          # Get user details with privacy controls
PUT    /api/v1/users/:id          # Update user with versioning and audit trail
DELETE /api/v1/users/:id          # Soft delete with audit trail and recovery

# Business Logic Endpoints (based on requirements)
GET    /api/v1/[resources]        # List with advanced filtering and pagination
POST   /api/v1/[resources]        # Create with validation and business rules
GET    /api/v1/[resources]/:id    # Retrieve with access control
PUT    /api/v1/[resources]/:id    # Update with conflict resolution
