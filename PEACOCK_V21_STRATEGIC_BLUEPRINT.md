STRATEGIC BLUEPRINT: PEACOCK | THE STRIKE ORCHESTRATOR (V21.3 OMEGA)

PRIME DIRECTIVE
Establish a high-fidelity, "Anti-Vibe" strategic factory for AI orchestration that transforms a static dashboard into a state-aware "Neural Journey" mindmap, enabling high-volume batch processing and precision manual strikes through a five-stage pipeline (Nexus, Spark, Falcon, Eagle, Hawk).

CORE ENGINE
The system operates on a strict Branching State Machine (IDLE → MODE_SELECTION → CONSOLE_SETUP → STRATEGIC_REVIEW → HOMING_RETRACTION → AUTO-HANDSHAKE) backed by a Segregated Warehouse architecture (IndexedDB) that isolates data streams for each stage to ensure browser stability under heavy loads.

TECHNICAL DNA

Runtime: React 19, TypeScript, Vite (MX Linux / Localhost-first).

Persistence Layer: IndexedDB (via Dexie.js) implementing a "Tactical Vault" with 10 segregated object stores (nexusIn, nexusOut, etc.) to bypass localStorage limits.

API Gateway: Centralized routing for Groq, Google (Gemini), Mistral, and DeepSeek; keys managed via LocalStorage (not DB).

Batch Engine: Asynchronous processor utilizing a "Sliding Window" buffer (25 items rendered max) to handle 500+ file ingestions without DOM bloat.

Export Protocol: Native Blob generation for single files and JSZip for batch dossier compilation.

UI/UX SPECIFICATION

Aesthetic: "The Matrix" / Hacker CLI style.

Colors: Void Black (#000000) background, Matrix Green (#00FF41) primary accent, Tactical Blue/Cyan for neural lines.

Typography: JetBrains Mono for data, Inter for UI elements.

Effects: 8px text glow, CRT scanline overlay, 1Hz blinking block cursor.

Neural Path: Dynamic SVG lines (Cubic Bezier) that physically connect stage buttons to active windows, growing and retracting based on state.

Animations: "Homing Retraction" — UI components scale to 0 and translate back into the parent button upon task completion.

Layout:

Top-Left: Identity Node (Randomized Logo peacock1-7.png).

Top-Right: Command HUD (Start Over, Settings, About).

Left Rail: Archive Sidebar (Vertical Tabs [N][S][F][E][H]).

Bottom: Live CLI Flare (30vh terminal).

OPERATIONAL WORKFLOW
A. The Neural Journey (Manual Mode)

Activation: User clicks a Stage Button (e.g., NEXUS). SVG line grows to split nodes: [MANUAL] / [BATCH].

Setup: User selects MANUAL. Dual consoles appear: "Master Protocol" (Immutable) and "Phase Payload" (File Drop).

Wrap: User ingests file. SVG lines converge on [WRAP PROMPT].

Review: User clicks Wrap. Interface transforms into a full-width Strategic Review Editor.

Strike: User authorizes strike. Live CLI flares up.

Homing: Upon success, UI retracts into the button. Button turns Green.

Handshake: SVG line snakes to the next stage (Spark). Output is auto-injected into Spark's input.

B. The Factory Floor (Batch Mode)

Ingestion: User drags 500 files into the perimeter.

Processing: System renders 25 cards. Processing begins.

Feedback: Cards update status (QUEUED → STRIKING → SUCCESS). Audio ping plays per file.

Archival: Results stream directly to IndexedDB.

Completion: [DOWNLOAD .ZIP DOSSIER] button appears.

C. The Archive Rail

Access: User clicks a tab on the left rail (e.g., [N]).

Flare: Drawer slides out covering 40% of the screen.

Security: Editing historical data requires clicking a Red Lock and typing "modify this data".

INTEL VAULT

Identity: User is "Matthew Trevino", a Systems Architect.

Philosophy: Zero tolerance for fabrication. "Anti-Vibe" means functional, industrial, high-density design over modern minimalism.

Assets: High-fidelity icons (nexus.png, spark.png, etc.) must replace generic text.

Monetization: "Support the Mission" donation button and GitHub links required in the Identity Node.

Preferences: Prefers "Start New Session" over "Purge". Requires confirmation headers (e.g., ### SPARK RESPONSE ###) on clipboard copies.
