# PEACOCK PRODUCT SPECIFICATION: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

# Problem:
Existing AI coding tools ("Peacocks") frustrate developers by focusing on human-like chat over functional reliability. They get lost, skip crucial planning, produce unreliable outputs (formatting errors), and fail to manage project scope, leading to wasted time and stalled progress.

# Solution:
Peacock (PKC) is a systematic, discipline-oriented AI system designed for reliable code development. It introduces a structured workflow with distinct modes for planning (PIM) and code refinement (CRM), guided by an intelligent MCP.

# Value Proposition:
Peacock (PKC) offers a magnitude improvement (potentially 3x better or more) over current tools by providing:
*   Reliable, structured communication (AIP).
*   Automatic planning and objective setting (PIM).
*   Effective scope management (SMF).
*   Persistent, external memory via a PKB of structured reports.
*   Precise, actionable code suggestions and analysis.
*   Safeguards against common human and AI inefficiencies.

# Key Differentiator:
Unlike "yes man" chatbots, Peacock (PKC) focuses on process integrity and project completion over conversational fluff, ensuring a clear path from idea to working code.

# Target User:
Software developers and learners frustrated with the unreliability and inefficiency of current AI coding assistants, seeking a disciplined tool to accelerate progress and deepen understanding.

# Goal:
To enable developers to reliably plan, build, and refine projects using AI, transforming AI from a frustrating novelty into a predictable, powerful tool for project completion.
