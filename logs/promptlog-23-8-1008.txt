**1. Core Objective:**

To develop a classic snake game that provides an engaging and challenging gaming experience for users.

**2. Current State:**

There is a demand for simple, nostalgic games that can be enjoyed across various platforms. Existing snake game implementations may lack modern features or polish.

**3. Target State:**

A well-designed and polished snake game that is accessible, enjoyable, and potentially offers unique features or variations on the classic gameplay.

**4. In Scope:**

- Core snake game mechanics (movement, growth, collision detection)
- Basic user interface (score display, game over screen)
- Multiple difficulty levels
- Optional power-ups or special items

**5. Out of Scope:**

- Complex 3D graphics or advanced physics
- Multiplayer functionality
- Extensive customization options
- Integration with social media or leaderboards

**Future Considerations:**

- Implementing advanced AI for opponent snakes
- Exploring different game modes or themes
- Adding online leaderboards and competitive features

I need to implement actual code based on this architecture.

Architecture: ## Spark's Snake Game Technical Architecture

**TECHNOLOGY STACK:**
- Frontend: **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (with a lightweight framework like React or Vue.js for better organization and potential future scaling)
- Backend: **Python (Flask)** -  Simple and efficient for handling game logic and data.
- Database: **SQLite** - Lightweight and sufficient for storing high scores and game settings.
- Additional: **Pygame** (for game rendering and input handling)

**CORE COMPONENTS:**

1. **Game Engine (Pygame):**  Responsible for rendering the game world, handling user input, updating game state, and managing game logic (snake movement, collision detection, scoring, etc.).
2. **Game State Manager:** Manages the game's current state, including snake position, food location, score, game speed, and difficulty level.
3. **UI Renderer:**  Renders the user interface elements (score display, game over screen, pause menu, etc.) based on the game state.

**FILE STRUCTURE:**

```
snake_game/
├── frontend/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── styles.css
│   ├── scripts.js
│   └── components/
│       └── Snake.js
├── backend/
│   ├── app.py
│   └── models.py
└── data/
    └── scores.db
```

**COMPONENT INTERACTIONS:**

- The **UI Renderer** receives updates from the **Game State Manager** and renders the corresponding UI elements.
- The **Game Engine** interacts with the **Game State Manager** to update the game state based on user input and game logic.
- The **Game Engine** also communicates with the **UI Renderer** to display game over screens or other UI elements when necessary.
- The **Backend** (Flask app) handles API requests for retrieving high scores from the database and potentially for saving new scores.

**JSON Representation:**

```json
{
    "tech_stack": {
        "frontend": "HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with React or Vue.js)",
        "backend": "Python (Flask)",
        "database": "SQLite"

        "Game State Manager",
        "UI Renderer"
    ],
    "complexity": "simple",
    "confidence_score": 8
}
```





I should:
- Generate complete, working code files
- Follow best practices
- Include proper error handling
- Make sure everything integrates properly

Generate complete, working code for each file specified in the architecture.

Format each file as:

**filename: path/to/file.ext**

Provide:
- Complete, production-ready code
- Proper error handling
- Clear documentation
- Best practices implementation
- All necessary imports and dependencies

Make it work perfectly from the start.

- Load testing requirements
- Scalability checkpoints
- Resource optimization

**4. Error Handling Scenarios:**
- Network failure handling
- Data corruption recovery
- User error management

**5. Production Readiness Checklist:**
- Deployment requirements
- Monitoring setup
- Backup strategies
