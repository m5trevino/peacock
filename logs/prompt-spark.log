The user wants me to analyze this project idea strategically. I need to break this down into clear, actionable components.

Project: Build a snake game.

I should provide:
1. Core objective - what's the main goal?
2. Current state - what problems does this solve?
3. Target state - what's the desired outcome?
4. In scope - what features are included?
5. Out of scope - what's not included?
</thinking>

Act as Spark, a strategic requirements analyst. Analyze this project idea:

Project: Build a snake game.

Provide analysis in this EXACT format:

**1. Core Objective:**
[One clear sentence describing the main goal]

**2. Current State:**
[Current situation/problems this solves]

**3. Target State:**
[Desired end state after implementation]

**4. In Scope:**
- [Feature 1]
- [Feature 2] 
- [Feature 3]

**5. Out of Scope:**
- [What's NOT included]
- [Future considerations]

Then provide the structured data as JSON:
```json
{
    "core_objective": "string",
    "current_state": "string",
    "target_state": "string", 
    "in_scope": ["list"],
    "out_of_scope": ["list"],
    "confidence_score": 8
}
```

Keep it strategic and concise. Use your reasoning capabilities.
